<h3 class="p6">PREFACE.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span></p>
<hr class="l15" />
<p>In pursuance of a general plan involving the production
of a series of works on the western half of North
America, I present this delineation of its aboriginal inhabitants
as the first. To the immense territory bordering
on the western ocean from Alaska to Darien, and including
the whole of Mexico and Central America, I give
arbitrarily, for want of a better, the name Pacific States.
Stretching almost from pole to equator, and embracing
within its limits nearly one tenth of the earth's surface,
this last Western Land offers to lovers of knowledge a
new and enticing field; and, although hitherto its several
parts have been held somewhat asunder by the force
of circumstances, yet are its occupants drawn by nature
into nearness of relationship, and will be brought yet
nearer by advancing civilization; the common oceanic
highway on the one side, and the great mountain ramparts
on the other, both tending to this result. The
characteristics of this vast domain, material and social,
are comparatively unknown and are essentially peculiar.
To its exotic civilization all the so-called older nations
of the world have contributed of their energies; and
this composite mass, leavened by its destiny, is now
working out the new problem of its future. The modern
history of this West antedates that of the East by over
a century, and although there may be apparent heterogeneity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
in the subject thus territorially treated, there is
an apparent tendency toward ultimate unity.</p>

<p class="p2">To some it may be of interest to know the nature and
extent of my resources for writing so important a series
of works. The books and manuscripts necessary for the
task existed in no library in the world; hence, in 1859,
I commenced collecting material relative to the Pacific
States. After securing everything within my reach in
America, I twice visited Europe, spending about two
years in thorough researches in England and the chief
cities of the Continent. Having exhausted every available
source, I was obliged to content myself with lying
in wait for opportunities. Not long afterward, and at
a time when the prospect of materially adding to my
collection seemed anything but hopeful, the <i>Biblioteca
Imperial de Méjico</i>, of the unfortunate Maximilian, collected
during a period of forty years by Don José María
Andrade, litterateur and publisher of the city of Mexico,
was thrown upon the European market and furnished
me about three thousand additional volumes.</p>

<p>In 1869, having accumulated some sixteen thousand
books, manuscripts, and pamphlets, besides maps and
cumbersome files of Pacific Coast journals, I determined
to go to work. But I soon found that, like Tantalus,
while up to my neck in water, I was dying of thirst.
The facts which I required were so copiously diluted
with trash, that to follow different subjects through this
trackless sea of erudition, in the exhaustive manner I
had proposed, with but one life-time to devote to the
work, was simply impracticable. In this emergency my
friend, Mr Henry L. Oak, librarian of the collection,
came to my relief. After many consultations,
and not a few partial failures, a system of indexing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
subject-matter of the whole library was devised, sufficiently
general to be practicable, and sufficiently particular
to direct me immediately to all my authorities on
any given point. The system, on trial, stands the test,
and the index when completed, as it already is for the
twelve hundred authors quoted in this work, will more
than double the practical value of the library.</p>

<p>Of the importance of the task undertaken, I need
not say that I have formed the highest opinion. At
present the few grains of wheat are so hidden by
the mountain of chaff as to be of comparatively little
benefit to searchers in the various branches of learning;
and to sift and select from this mass, to extract
from bulky tome and transient journal, from the archives
of convent and mission, facts valuable to the scholar
and interesting to the general reader; to arrange these
facts in a natural order, and to present them in such a
manner as to be of practical benefit to inquirers in the
various branches of knowledge, is a work of no small
import and responsibility. And though mine is the
labor of the artisan rather than that of the artist, a forging
of weapons for abler hands to wield, a producing
of raw materials for skilled mechanics to weave and
color at will; yet, in undertaking to bring to light from
sources innumerable essential facts, which, from the
very shortness of life if from no other cause, must otherwise
be left out in the physical and social generalizations
which occupy the ablest minds, I feel that I engage in
no idle pastime.</p>

<p class="p2">A word as to the Nations of which this work is a description,
and my method of treating the subject. Aboriginally,
for a savage wilderness, there was here a dense
population; particularly south of the thirtieth parallel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">x</a></span>
and along the border of the ocean north of that line.
Before the advent of Europeans, this domain counted
its aborigines by millions; ranked among its people
every phase of primitive humanity, from the reptile-eating
cave-dweller of the Great Basin, to the Aztec and
Maya-Quiché civilization of the southern table-land,&mdash;a
civilization, if we may credit Dr Draper, "that
might have instructed Europe," a culture wantonly
crushed by Spain, who therein "destroyed races more
civilized than herself."</p>

<p>Differing among themselves in minor particulars only,
and bearing a general resemblance to the nations of eastern
and southern America; differing again, the whole,
in character and cast of features from every other people
of the world, we have here presented hundreds of
nations and tongues, with thousands of beliefs and
customs, wonderfully dissimilar for so segregated a
humanity, yet wonderfully alike for the inhabitants of
a land that comprises within its limits nearly every phase
of climate on the globe. At the touch of European
civilization, whether Latin or Teutonic, these nations
vanished; and their unwritten history, reaching back
for thousands of ages, ended. All this time they had
been coming and going, nations swallowing up nations,
annihilating and being annihilated, amidst human convulsions
and struggling civilizations. Their strange
destiny fulfilled, in an instant they disappear; and all
we have of them, besides their material relics, is the
glance caught in their hasty flight, which gives us a
few customs and traditions, and a little mythological
history.</p>

<p>To gather and arrange in systematic compact form all
that is known of these people; to rescue some facts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">xi</a></span>
perhaps, from oblivion, to bring others from inaccessible
nooks, to render all available to science and to the
general reader, is the object of this work. Necessarily
some parts of it may be open to the charge of dryness;
I have not been able to interlard my facts with interesting
anecdotes for lack of space, and I have endeavored
to avoid speculation, believing, as I do, the work of the
collector and that of the theorizer to be distinct, and
that he who attempts to establish some pet conjecture
while imparting general information, can hardly be
trusted for impartial statements. With respect to the
territorial divisions of the first volume, which is confined
to the Wild Tribes, and the necessity of giving
descriptions of the same characteristics in each, there
may be an appearance of repetition; but I trust this
may be found more apparent than real. Although there
are many similar customs, there are also many minor
differences, and, as one of the chief difficulties of this
volume was to keep it within reasonable limits, no delineation
has been repeated where a necessity did not appear
to exist. The second volume, which treats of the
Civilized Nations, offers a more fascinating field, and
with ample space and all existing authorities at hand,
the fault is the writer's if interest be not here combined
with value. As regards Mythology, Languages, Antiquities,
and Migrations, of which the three remaining
volumes treat, it has been my aim to present clearly and
concisely all knowledge extant on these subjects; and
the work, as a whole, is intended to embody all facts that
have been preserved concerning these people at the time
of their almost simultaneous discovery and disappearance.
It will be noticed that I have said little of the
natives or their deeds since the coming of the Europeans;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span>
of their wars against invaders and among themselves;
of repartimientos, presidios, missions, reservations,
and other institutions for their conquest, conversion,
protection, or oppression. My reason for this is
that all these things, so far as they have any importance,
belong to the modern history of the country and will
receive due attention in a subsequent work.</p>

<p>In these five volumes, besides information acquired
from sources not therein named, are condensed the researches
of twelve hundred writers, a list of whose works,
with the edition used, is given in this volume. I
have endeavored to state fully and clearly in my text
the substance of the matter, and in reaching my conclusions
to use due discrimination as to the respective value
of different authorities. In the notes I give liberal quotations,
both corroborative of the text, and touching points
on which authors differ, together with complete references
to all authorities, including some of little value, on each
point, for the use of readers or writers who may either
be dissatisfied with my conclusions, or may wish to investigate
any particular branch of the subject farther
than my limits allow.</p>

<p>I have given full credit to each of the many authors
from whom I have taken material, and if, in a few instances,
a scarcity of authorities has compelled me to
draw somewhat largely on the few who have treated particular
points, I trust I shall be pardoned in view of
the comprehensive nature of the work. Quotations
are made in the languages in which they are written,
and great pains has been taken to avoid mutilation of
the author's words. As the books quoted form part of
my private library, I have been able, by comparison
with the originals, to carefully verify all references after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span>
they were put in type; hence I may confidently hope
that fewer errors have crept in than are usually found
in works of such variety and extent.</p>

<p>The labor involved in the preparation of these volumes
will be appreciated by few. That expended on the first
volume alone, with all the material before me, is more
than equivalent to the well-directed efforts of one person
for ten years. In the work of selecting, sifting, and arranging
my subject-matter, I have called in the aid of a
large corps of assistants, and, while desiring to place on
no one but myself any responsibility for the work, either
in style or matter, I would render just acknowledgment
for the services of all; especially to the following gentlemen,
for the efficient manner in which, each in his
special department, they have devoted their energies and
abilities to the carrying out of my plan;&mdash;to Mr T.
Arundel-Harcourt, in the researches on the manners
and customs of the Civilized Nations; to Mr Walter M.
Fisher, in the investigation of Mythology; to Mr Albert
Goldschmidt, in the treatise on Language; and to Mr
Henry L. Oak, in the subject of Antiquities and Aboriginal
History.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV"></a></span></p>

and Plants&mdash;Primordial Centres of Population&mdash;Distribution of
Plants and Animals&mdash;Adaptability of Species to Locality&mdash;Classification

<p>Facts are the raw material of science. They are to
philosophy and history, what cotton and iron are to
cloth and steam-engines. Like the raw material of the
manufacturer, they form the bases of innumerable fabrics,
are woven into many theories finely spun or coarsely
spun, which wear out with time, become unfashionable,
or else prove to be indeed true and fit, and as such remain.
This raw material of the scholar, like that of the
manufacturer, is always a staple article; its substance
never changes, its value never diminishes; whatever
may be the condition of society, or howsoever advanced
the mind, it is indispensable. Theories may be only for
the day, but facts are for all time and for all science.
When we remember that the sum of all knowledge is
but the sum of ascertained facts, and that every new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
fact brought to light, preserved, and thrown into the
general fund, is so much added to the world's store of
knowledge,&mdash;when we consider that, broad and far as our
theories may reach, the realm of definite, tangible, ascertained
truth is still of so little extent, the importance
of every never-so-insignificant acquisition is manifest.
Compare any fact with the fancies which have been
prevalent concerning it, and consider, I will not say
their relative brilliance, but their relative importance.
Take electricity, how many explanations have been
given of the lightning and the thunder, yet there is but
one fact; the atmosphere, how many howling demons
have directed the tempest, how many smiling deities
moved in the soft breeze. For the one all-sufficient
First Cause, how many myriads of gods have been set
up; for every phenomenon how many causes have been
invented; with every truth how many untruths have
contended, with every fact how many fancies. The
profound investigations of latter-day philosophers are
nothing but simple and laborious inductions from ascertained
facts, facts concerning attraction, polarity, chemical
affinity and the like, for the explanation of which
there are countless hypotheses, each hypothesis involving
multitudes of speculations, all of which evaporate as the
truth slowly crystallizes. Speculation is valuable to
science only as it directs the mind into otherwise-undiscoverable
paths; but when the truth is found, there is
an end to speculation.</p>

<p>So much for facts in general; let us now look for a
moment at the particular class of facts of which this
work is a collection.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TENDENCY OF PHILOSOPHIC INQUIRY.</p>

<p>The tendency of philosophic inquiry is more and more
toward the origin of things. In the earlier stages of
intellectual impulse, the mind is almost wholly absorbed
in ministering to the necessities of the present; next, the
mysterious uncertainty of the after life provokes inquiry,
and contemplations of an eternity of the future command
attention; but not until knowledge is well advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
does it appear that there is likewise an eternity of the
past worthy of careful scrutiny,&mdash;without which scrutiny,
indeed, the eternity of the future must forever remain
a sealed book. Standing as we do between these
two eternities, our view limited to a narrow though
gradually widening horizon, as nature unveils her mysteries
to our inquiries, an infinity spreads out in either
direction, an infinity of minuteness no less than an
infinity of immensity; for hitherto, attempts to reach the
ultimate of molecules, have proved as futile as attempts
to reach the ultimate of masses. Now man, the noblest
work of creation, the only reasoning creature, standing
alone in the midst of this vast sea of undiscovered truth,&mdash;ultimate
knowledge ever receding from his grasp, primal
causes only thrown farther back as proximate problems
are solved,&mdash;man, in the study of mankind, must follow
his researches in both of these directions, backward as
well as forward, must indeed derive his whole knowledge
of what man is and will be from what he has been.
Thus it is that the study of mankind in its minuteness
assumes the grandest proportions. Viewed in this light
there is not a feature of primitive humanity without significance;
there is not a custom or characteristic of savage
nations, however mean or revolting to us, from which
important lessons may not be drawn. It is only from
the study of barbarous and partially cultivated nations
that we are able to comprehend man as a progressive
being, and to recognize the successive stages through
which our savage ancestors have passed on their way to
civilization. With the natural philosopher, there is little
thought as to the relative importance of the manifold
works of creation. The tiny insect is no less an object
of his patient scrutiny, than the wonderful and complex
machinery of the cosmos. The lower races of men, in
the study of humanity, he deems of as essential importance
as the higher; our present higher races being but
the lower types of generations yet to come.</p>

<p>Hence, if in the following pages, in the array of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
minute facts incident to the successive peoples of which
we speak, some of them appear small and unworthy of
notice, let it be remembered that in nature there is no
such thing as insignificance; still less is there anything
connected with man unworthy of our most careful study,
or any peculiarity of savagism irrelevant to civilization.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF MAN.</p>

<p class="p2">Different schools of naturalists maintain widely different
opinions regarding the origin of mankind. Existing
theories may be broadly divided into three categories;
in the first two of which man is considered as a special
creation, and in the third as a natural development from
some lower type. The special-creation school is divided
on the question of unity or diversity of race. The first
party holds by the time-honored tradition, that all the
nations of the earth are descended from a single human
pair; the second affirms, that by one creative act were produced
several special creations, each separate creation being
the origin of a race, and each race primordially adapted
to that part of the globe which it now inhabits. The third
theory, that of the development school, denies that there
ever were common centres of origin in organic creation;
but claims that plants and animals generate spontaneously,
and that man is but the modification of some preexisting
animal form.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HYPOTHESES CONCERNING ORIGIN.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis, the doctrine of the monogenists,
is ably supported by Latham, Prichard, and many other
eminent ethnologists of Europe, and is the favorite
opinion of orthodox thinkers throughout Christendom.
The human race, they say, having sprung from a single
pair, constitutes but one stock, though subject to various
modifications. Anatomically, there is no difference between
a Negro and a European. The color of the skin,
the texture of the hair, the convolutions of the brain,
and all other peculiarities, may be attributed to heat,
moisture, and food. Man, though capable of subduing
the world to himself, and of making his home under
climates and circumstances the most diverse, is none the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
less a child of nature, acted upon and molded by those
conditions which he attempts to govern. Climate, periodicities
of nature, material surroundings, habits of
thought and modes of life, acting through a long series
of ages, exercise a powerful influence upon the human
physical organization; and yet man is perfectly created
for any sphere in which he may dwell; and is governed
in his condition by choice rather than by coercion.
Articulate language, which forms the great line of demarcation
between the human and the brute creation,
may be traced in its leading characteristics to one common
source. The differences between the races of men
are not specific differences. The greater part of the
flora and fauna of America, those of the circumpolar
regions excepted, are essentially dissimilar to those of
the old world; while man in the new world, though
bearing traces of high antiquity, is specifically identical
with all the races of the earth. It is well known that
the hybrids of plants and of animals do not possess the
power of reproduction, while in the intermixture of the
races of men no such sterility of progeny can be found;
and therefore, as there are no human hybrids, there are
no separate human races or species, but all are one family.
Besides being consistent with sound reasoning, this
theory can bring to its support the testimony of the
sacred writings, and an internal evidence of a creation
divine and spiritual, which is sanctioned by tradition,
and confirmed by most philosophic minds. Man,
unlike animals, is the direct offspring of the Creator,
and as such he alone continues to derive his inheritance
from a divine source. The Hebraic record, continue
the monogenists, is the only authentic solution of
the origin of all things; and its history is not only fully
sustained by science, but it is upheld by the traditions
of the most ancient barbarous nations, whose mythology
strikingly resembles the Mosaic account of the creation,
the deluge, and the distribution of peoples. The Semitic
family alone were civilized from the beginning. A peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
people, constantly upheld by special act of Providence
from falling into paganism, they alone possessed a
true knowledge of the mystery of creation. A universal
necessity for some form of worship, a belief inherent in
all mankind, in an omnipotent deity and a life beyond
the grave, point to a common origin and prophesy a
common destiny. This much for the monogenists.</p>

<p>The second hypothesis, that of the polygenists, holds
that there was not one only, but several independent
creations, each giving birth to the essential, unchangeable
peculiarities of a separate race; thus constituting a diversity
of species with primeval adaptation to their
geographical distribution. Morton, Agassiz, Gliddon,
and others in America, stand sponsors for this theory.
The physiological differences of race, they say, which
separate mankind into classes, do not result from climatic
surroundings, but are inherited from original progenitors.
They point to marked characteristics in various peoples
which have remained unchanged for a period of four
thousand years. In place of controverting divine revelation,
they claim that Mosaic history is the history of a
single race, and not the history of all mankind; that the
record itself contains an implied existence of other races;
and that the distribution of the various species or races
of men, according to their relative organisms, was part
of the creative act, and of no less importance than was
the act of creation.</p>

<p>The third hypothesis, derived mainly from the writings
of Lamarck, Darwin, and Huxley, is based upon the
principle of evolution. All existing species are developments
of some preëxisting form, which in like manner
descended by true generation from a form still lower.
Man, say they, bears no impress of a divine original that is
not common to brutes; he is but an animal, more perfectly
developed through natural and sexual selection. Commencing
with the spontaneous generation of the lowest
types of vegetable and animal life,&mdash;as the accumulation
of mold upon food, the swarming of maggots in meat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the infusorial animalcules in water, the generation of
insect life in decaying vegetable substances,&mdash;the birth of
one form arising out of the decay of another, the slow
and gradual unfolding from a lower to a higher sphere,
acting through a long succession of ages, culminate in the
grandeur of intellectual manhood. Thus much for this
life, while the hope of a like continued progress is entertained
for the life to come. While the tendency of variety
in organic forms is to decrease, argue these latter-day
naturalists, individuals increase in a proportion greater
than the provisional means of support. A predominating
species, under favorable circumstances, rapidly
multiplies, crowding out and annihilating opposing species.
There is therefore a constant struggle for existence
in nature, in which the strongest, those best fitted to live
and improve their species, prevail; while the deformed
and ill-favored are destroyed. In courtship and sexual
selection the war for precedence continues. Throughout
nature the male is the wooer; he it is who is armed for
fight, and provided with musical organs and ornamental
appendages, with which to charm the fair one. The
savage and the wild beast alike secure their mate over
the mangled form of a vanquished rival. In this manner
the more highly favored of either sex are mated,
and natural selections made, by which, better ever producing
better, the species in its constant variation is
constantly improved. Many remarkable resemblances
may be seen between man and the inferior animals. In
embryonic development, in physical structure, in material
composition and the function of organs, man and animals
are strikingly alike. And, in the possession of that
immaterial nature which more widely separates the
human from the brute creation, the 'reasonable soul'
of man is but an evolution from brute instincts. The
difference in the mental faculties of man and animals
is immense; but the high culture which belongs to
man has been slowly developed, and there is plainly a
wider separation between the mental power of the lowest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
zoöphyte and the highest ape, than between the most
intellectual ape and the least intellectual man. Physically
and mentally, the man-like ape and the ape-like
man sustain to each other a near relationship; while
between the mammal and the mollusk there exists the
greatest possible dissimilarity. Articulate language, it
is true, acting upon the brain, and in turn being acted
upon to the improvement of both, belongs only to man;
yet animals are not devoid of expedients for expressing
feeling and emotion. It has been observed that no
brute ever fashioned a tool for a special purpose; but
some animals crack nuts with a stone, and an accidentally
splintered flint naturally suggests itself as the first
instrument of primeval man. The chief difficulty lies
in the high state of moral and intellectual power which
may be attained by man; yet this same progressive
principle is likewise found in brutes. Nor need we
blush for our origin. The nations now most civilized
were once barbarians. Our ancestors were savages, who,
with tangled hair, and glaring eyes, and blood-besmeared
hands, devoured man and beast alike. Surely a respectable
gorilla lineage stands no unfavorable comparison.</p>

<p>Between the first and the last of these three rallying
points, a whole continent of debatable land is spread,
stretching from the most conservative orthodoxy to the
most scientific liberalism. Numberless arguments may
be advanced to sustain any given position; and not unfrequently
the same analogies are brought forward to
prove propositions directly oppugnant. As has been observed,
each school ranks among its followers the ablest
men of science of the day. These men do not differ in
minor particulars only, meeting in general upon one
broad, common platform; on the contrary, they find
themselves unable to agree as touching any one thing,
except that man is, and that he is surrounded by those
climatic influences best suited to his organization. Any
one of these theories, if substantiated, is the death-blow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of the others. The first denies any diversity of species
in creation and all immutability of race; the second
denies a unity of species and the possibility of change
in race; the third denies all special acts of creation and,
like the first, all immutability of race.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PLANTS AND ANIMALS.</p>

<p>The question respecting the origin of animals and
plants has likewise undergone a similar flux of beliefs,
but with different result. Whatever the conclusions
may be with regard to the origin of man, naturalists of
the present day very generally agree, that there was no
one universal centre of propagation for plants and animals;
but that the same conditions of soil, moisture,
heat, and geographical situation, always produce a similarity
of species; or, what is equivalent, that there were
many primary centres, each originating species, which
spread out from these centres and covered the earth.
This doctrine was held by early naturalists to be irreconcilable
with the Scripture account of the creation, and
was therefore denounced as heretical. Linnæus and his
contemporaries drew up a pleasing picture, assigning the
birth-place of all forms of life to one particular fertile
spot, situated in a genial climate, and so diversified with
lofty mountains and declivities, as to present all the
various temperatures requisite for the sustenance of the
different species of animal and vegetable life. The most
exuberant types of flora and fauna are found within the
tropical regions, decreasing in richness and profusion
towards either pole; while man in his greatest perfection
occupies the temperate zone, degenerating in harmony of
features, in physical symmetry, and in intellectual vigor
in either direction. Within this temperate zone is placed
the hypothetical cradle of the human race, varying in
locality according to religion and tradition. The Caucasians
are referred for their origin to Mount Caucasus,
the Mongolians to Mount Altai, and the Africans to
Mount Atlas. Three primordial centres of population
have been assigned to the three sons of Noah,&mdash;Arabia,
the Semitic; India, the Japetic; and Egypt, the Hamitic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
centre. Thibet, and the mountains surrounding the Gobi
desert, have been designated as the point from which a
general distribution was made; while the sacred writings
mention four rich and beautiful valleys, two of which are
watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, as the birth-place
of man. It was formerly believed that in the beginning,
the primeval ocean covered the remaining portion of the
globe, and that from this central spot the waters receded,
thereby extending the limits of terrestrial life.</p>

<p>Admitting the unity of origin, conjecture points with
apparent reason to the regions of Armenia and of Iran,
in western Asia, as the cradle of the human race. Departing
from this geographical centre, in the directions
of the extremities of the continent, the race at first degenerated
in proportion to distance. Civilization was for
many ages confined within these central limits, until by
slow degrees, paths were marked out to the eastward and
to the westward, terminating the one upon the eastern
coast of Asia, and the other upon the American shores
of the Pacific.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRIMORDIAL CENTERS.</p>

<p>Concerning the distribution of plants and animals,
but one general opinion is now sustained with any degree
of reason. The beautifully varied systems of vegetation
with which the habitable earth is clothed, springing
up in rich, spontaneous abundance; the botanical centres
of corresponding latitudes producing resemblance in genera
without identity of species; their inability to cross
high mountains or wide seas, or to pass through inhospitable
zones, or in any way to spread far from the original
centre,&mdash;all show conclusively the impossibility that such
a multitude of animal and vegetable tribes, with characters
so diverse, could have derived their origin from
the same locality, and disappearing entirely from their
original birth-place, sprung forth in some remote part of
the globe. Linnæus, and many others of his time, held
that all telluric tribes, in common with mankind, sprang
from a single pair, and descended from the stock which
was preserved by Noah. Subsequently this opinion was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
modified, giving to each species an origin in some certain
spot to which it was particularly adapted by nature; and
it was supposed that from these primary centres, through
secondary causes, there was a general diffusion throughout
the surrounding regions.</p>

<p>A comparison of the entomology of the old world and
the new, shows that the genera and species of insects are
for the most part peculiar to the localities in which they
are found. Birds and marine animals, although unrestricted
in their movements, seldom wander far from
specific centres. With regard to wild beasts, and the
larger animals, insurmountable difficulties present themselves;
so that we may infer that the systems of animal
life are indigenous to the great zoölogical provinces
where they are found.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the harmony which exists between
the organism of man and the methods by which
nature meets his requirements, tends conclusively to
show that the world in its variety was made for man,
and that man is made for any portion of the earth in
which he may be found. Whencesoever he comes, or
howsoever he reaches his dwelling-place, he always finds it
prepared for him. On the icy banks of the Arctic Ocean,
where mercury freezes and the ground never softens, the
Eskimo, wrapped in furs, and burrowing in the earth,
revels in grease and train-oil, sustains vitality by eating
raw flesh and whale-fat; while the naked inter-tropical
man luxuriates in life under a burning sun, where ether
boils and reptiles shrivel upon the hot stone over which
they attempt to crawl. The watery fruit and shading
vegetation would be as useless to the one, as the heating
food and animal clothing would be to the other.</p>

<p>The capability of man to endure all climates, his omnivorous
habits, and his powers of locomotion, enable
him to roam at will over the earth. He was endowed
with intelligence wherewith to invent methods of migration
and means of protection from unfavorable climatic
influence, and with capabilities for existing in almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
any part of the world; so that, in the economy of nature
the necessity did not exist with regard to man for that
diversity of creation which was deemed requisite in the
case of plants and animals.</p>

<p>The classification of man into species or races, so as
to be able to designate by his organization the family to
which he belongs, as well as the question of his origin,
has been the subject of great diversity of opinion from
the fact that the various forms so graduate into each
other, that it is impossible to determine which is species
and which variety. Attempts have indeed been made
at divisions of men into classes according to their primeval
and permanent physiological structure, but what
uniformity can be expected from such a classification
among naturalists who cannot so much as agree what is
primeval and what permanent?</p>

<p>The tests applied by ethnologists for distinguishing the
race to which an individual belongs, are the color of the
skin, the size and shape of the skull,&mdash;determined generally
by the facial angle,&mdash;the texture of the hair, and
the character of the features. The structure of language,
also, has an important bearing upon the affinity of races;
and is, with some ethnologists, the primary criterion in
the classification of species. The facial angle is determined
by a line drawn from the forehead to the
front of the upper jaw, intersected by a horizontal line
passing over the middle of the ear. The facial angle
of a European is estimated at 85°, of a Negro at 75°,
and of the ape at 60°. Representations of an adult
Troglodyte measure 35°, and of a Satyr 30°. Some
writers classify according to one or several of these tests,
others consider them all in arriving at their conclusions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS.</p>

<p>Thus, Virey divides the human family into two
parts: those with a facial angle of from eighty-five
to ninety degrees,&mdash;embracing the Caucasian, Mongolian,
and American; and those with a facial angle of
from seventy-five to eighty-two degrees,&mdash;including
the Malay, Negro, and Hottentot. Cuvier and Jaquinot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
make three classes, placing the Malay and American
among the subdivisions of the Mongolian. Kant makes
four divisions under four colors: white, black, copper, and
olive. Linnæus also makes four: European, whitish;
American, coppery; Asiatic, tawny; and African, black.
Buffon makes five divisions and Blumenbach five. Blumenbach's
classification is based upon cranial admeasurements,
complexion, and texture of the hair. His divisions
are Caucasian or Aryan, Mongolian, Ethiopian,
Malay, and American. Lesson makes six divisions according
to colors: white, dusky, orange, yellow, red,
and black. Bory de St Vincent arranges fifteen stocks
under three classes which are differenced by hair: European
straight hair, American straight hair, and crisped
or curly hair. In like manner Prof. Zeune designates
his divisions under three types of crania for the eastern
hemisphere, and three for the western, namely, high
skulls, broad skulls, and long skulls. Hunter classifies
the human family under seven species; Agassiz makes
eight; Pickering, eleven; Desmoulins, sixteen; and
Crawford, sixty-three. Dr Latham, considered by many
the chief exponent of the science of ethnology in England,
classifies the different races under three primary
divisions, namely: Mongolidæ, Atlantidæ, and Japetidæ.
Prichard makes three principal types of cranial conformation,
which he denominates respectively, the civilized
races, the nomadic or wandering races, and the savage
or hunting races. Agassiz designates the races of men
according to the zoölogical provinces which they respectively
occupy. Thus the Arctic realm is inhabited by
Hyperboreans, the Asiatic by Mongols, the European
by white men, the American by American Indians, the
African by black races, and the East Indian, Australian
and Polynesian by their respective peoples.</p>

<p>Now when we consider the wide differences between
naturalists, not only as to what constitutes race and
species,&mdash;if there be variety of species in the human
family,&mdash;but also in the assignment of peoples and individuals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
to their respective categories under the direction
of the given tests; when we see the human race classified
under from one to sixty-three distinct species,
according to individual opinions; and when we see that
the several tests which govern classification are by no
means satisfactory, and that those who have made this
subject the study of their lives, cannot agree as touching
the fundamental characteristics of such classification&mdash;we
cannot but conclude, either that there are no absolute
lines of separation between the various members of
the human family, or that thus far the touchstone by
which such separation is to be made remains undiscovered.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ALL TESTS FALLACIOUS.</p>

<p>The color of the human skin, for example, is no certain
guide in classification. Microscopists have ascertained
that the normal colorations of the skin are not the
results of organic differences in race; that complexions
are not permanent physical characters, but are subject
to change. Climate is a cause of physical differences,
and frequently in a single tribe may be found
shades of color extending through all the various transitions
from black to white. In one people, part occupying
a cold mountainous region, and part a heated lowland,
a marked difference in color is always perceptible.
Peculiarities in the texture of the hair are likewise no
proof of race. The hair is more sensibly affected by
the action of the climate than the skin. Every degree
of color and crispation may be found in the European
family alone; and even among the frizzled locks
of negroes every gradation appears, from crisped to
flowing hair. The growth of the beard may be cultivated
or retarded according to the caprice of the individual;
and in those tribes which are characterized by an
absence or thinness of beard, may be found the practice,
continued for ages, of carefully plucking out all traces
of beard at the age of puberty. No physiological deformities
have been discovered which prevent any people
from cultivating a beard if such be their pleasure. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
conformation of the cranium is often peculiar to habits
of rearing the young, and may be modified by accidental
or artificial causes. The most eminent scholars
now hold the opinion that the size and shape of the skull
has far less influence upon the intelligence of the individual
than the quality and convolutions of the brain.
The structure of language, especially when offered in
evidence supplementary to that of physical science, is
most important in establishing a relationship between
races. But it should be borne in mind that languages
are acquired, not inherited; that they are less permanent
than living organisms; that they are constantly changing,
merging into each other, one dialect dying out and another
springing into existence; that in the migrations of
nomadic tribes, or in the arrival of new nations, although
languages may for a time preserve their severalty, they
are at last obliged, from necessity, to yield to the assimilating
influences which constantly surround them,
and become merged into the dialects of neighboring
clans. And on the other hand, a counter influence
is exercised upon the absorbing dialect. The dialectic
fusion of two communities results in the partial disappearance
of both languages, so that a constant assimilation
and dissimilation is going on. "The value of language,"
says Latham, "has been overrated;" and Whitney
affirms that "language is no infallible sign of race;"
although both of these authors give to language the first
place as a test of national affinities. Language is not a
physiological characteristic, but an acquisition; and as
such should be used with care in the classification of
species.</p>

<p>Science, during the last half century, has unfolded
many important secrets; has tamed impetuous elements,
called forth power and life from the hidden recesses of
the earth; has aroused the slumbering energies of both
mental and material force, changed the currents of
thought, emancipated the intellect from religious transcendentalism,
and spread out to the broad light of open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
day a vast sea of truth. Old-time beliefs have had to
give place. The débris of one exploded dogma is scarcely
cleared away before we are startled with a request for
the yielding up of another long and dearly cherished
opinion. And in the attempt to read the book of humanity
as it comes fresh from the impress of nature, to
trace the history of the human race, by means of moral
and physical characteristics, backward through all its
intricate windings to its source, science has accomplished
much; but the attempt to solve the great problem of
human existence, by analogous comparisons of man with
man, and man with animals, has so far been vain and
futile in the extreme.</p>

<p>I would not be understood as attempting captiously to
decry the noble efforts of learned men to solve the problems
of nature. For who can tell what may or may
not be found out by inquiry? Any classification, moreover,
and any attempt at classification, is better than
none; and in drawing attention to the uncertainty of
the conclusions arrived at by science, I but reiterate
the opinions of the most profound thinkers of the day.
It is only shallow and flippant scientists, so called,
who arbitrarily force deductions from mere postulates,
and with one sweeping assertion strive to annihilate all
history and tradition. They attempt dogmatically to set
up a reign of intellect in opposition to that of the Author
of intellect. Terms of vituperation and contempt with
which a certain class of writers interlard their sophisms,
as applied to those holding different opinions, are alike
an offense against good taste and sound reasoning.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these failures to establish rules
by which mankind may be divided into classes, there
yet remains the stubborn fact that differences do exist,
as palpable as the difference between daylight and
darkness. These differences, however, are so played
upon by change, that hitherto the scholar has been unable
to transfix those elements which appear to him
permanent and characteristic. For, as Draper remarks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
"the permanence of organic forms is altogether dependent
on the invariability of the material conditions under
which they live. Any variation therein, no matter how
insignificant it might be, would be forthwith followed by
a corresponding variation in form. The present invariability
of the world of organization is the direct consequence
of the physical equilibrium, and so it will continue
as long as the mean temperature, the annual supply
of light, the composition of the air, the distribution of
water, oceanic and atmospheric currents, and other such
agencies, remain unaltered; but if any one of these, or
of a hundred other incidents that might be mentioned,
should suffer modification, in an instant the fanciful doctrine
of the immutability of species would be brought to
its true value."</p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE INDIANS.</p>

<p>The American Indians, their origin and consanguinity,
have, from the days of Columbus to the present time
proved no less a knotty question. Schoolmen and scientists
count their theories by hundreds, each sustaining
some pet conjecture, with a logical clearness equaled
only by the facility with which he demolishes all the
rest. One proves their origin by holy writ; another
by the writings of ancient philosophers; another by the
sage sayings of the Fathers. One discovers in them
Ph&oelig;nician merchants; another, the ten lost tribes of
Israel. They are tracked with equal certainty from
Scandinavia, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Greenland,
across Bering Strait, across the northern Pacific,
the southern Pacific, from the Polynesian Islands, from
Australia, from Africa. Venturesome Carthaginians were
thrown upon the eastern shore; Japanese junks on the
western. The breezes that wafted hither America's primogenitors
are still blowing, and the ocean currents by which
they came cease not yet to flow. The finely spun webs of
logic by which these fancies are maintained would prove
amusing, did not the profound earnestness of their respective
advocates render them ridiculous. Acosta, who
studied the subject for nine years in Peru, concludes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that America was the Ophir of Solomon. Aristotle relates
that the Carthaginians in a voyage were carried to
an unknown island; whereupon Florian, Gomara, Oviedo,
and others, are satisfied that the island was Española.
"Who are these that fly as a cloud," exclaims Esaias,
"or as the doves to their windows?" Scholastic sages
answer, Columbus is the <i>columba</i> or dove here prophesied.
Alexo Vanegas shows that America was peopled by Carthaginians;
Anahuac being but another name for Anak.
Besides, both nations practiced picture-writing; both
venerated fire and water, wore skins of animals, pierced
the ears, ate dogs, drank to excess, telegraphed by means
of fires on hills, wore all their finery on going to war,
poisoned their arrows, beat drums and shouted in battle.
Garcia found a man in Peru who had seen a rock with
something very like Greek letters engraved upon it; six
hundred years after the apotheosis of Hercules, Coleo
made a long voyage; Homer knew of the ocean; the
Athenians waged war with the inhabitants of Atlantis;
hence the American Indians were Greeks. Lord Kingsborough
proves conclusively that these same American
Indians were Jews: because their "symbol of innocence"
was in the one case a fawn and in the other a
lamb; because of the law of Moses, "considered in reference
to the custom of sacrificing children, which existed
in Mexico and Peru;" because "the fears of tumults
of the people, famine, pestilence, and warlike invasions,
were exactly the same as those entertained by the Jews
if they failed in the performance of any of their ritual
observances;" because "the education of children commenced
amongst the Mexicans, as with the Jews, at an
exceedingly early age;" because "beating with a stick
was a very common punishment amongst the Jews," as
well as among the Mexicans; because the priesthood of
both nations "was hereditary in a certain family;" because
both were inclined to pay great respect to lucky
or unlucky omens, such as the screeching of the owl,
the sneezing of a person in company," etc., and because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of a hundred other equally sound and relevant arguments.
Analogous reasoning to this of Lord Kingsborough's
was that of the Merced Indians of California.
Shortly after the discovery of the Yosemite Valley,
tidings reached the settlers of Mariposa that certain
chiefs had united with intent to drop down from their
mountain stronghold and annihilate them. To show
the Indians the uselessness of warring upon white men,
these chieftains were invited to visit the city of San
Francisco, where, from the number and superiority of
the people that they would there behold, they should
become intimidated, and thereafter maintain peace. But
contrary to the most reasonable expectations, no sooner had
the dusky delegates returned to their home than a council
was called, and the assembled warriors were informed
that they need have no fear of these strangers: "For,"
said the envoys, "the people of the great city of San Francisco
are of a different tribe from these white settlers of
Mariposa. Their manners, their customs, their language,
their dress, are all different. They wear black coats and
high hats, and are not able to walk along the smoothest
path without the aid of a stick."</p>

<p>There are many advocates for an Asiatic origin, both
among ancient and modern speculators. Favorable
winds and currents, the short distance between islands,
traditions, both Chinese and Indian, refer the peopling of
America to that quarter. Similarity in color, features,
religion, reckoning of time, absence of a heavy beard,
and innumerable other comparisons, are drawn by enthusiastic
advocates, to support a Mongolian origin. The
same arguments, in whole or in part, are used to prove
that America was peopled by Egyptians, by Ethiopians,
by French, English, Trojans, Frisians, Scythians; and
also that different parts were settled by different peoples.
The test of language has been applied with equal facility
and enthusiasm to Egyptian, Jew, Ph&oelig;nician, Carthaginian,
Spaniard, Chinese, Japanese, and in fact to nearly
all the nations of the earth. A complete review of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
theories and opinions concerning the origin of the Indians,
I propose to give in another place; not that intrinsically
they are of much value, except as showing the
different fancies of different men and times. Fancies, I
say, for modern scholars, with the aid of all the new revelations
of science, do not appear in their investigations
to arrive one whit nearer an indubitable conclusion.</p>

<p>It was obvious to the Europeans when they first
beheld the natives of America, that these were unlike
the intellectual white-skinned race of Europe, the barbarous
blacks of Africa, or any nation or people which
they had hitherto encountered, yet were strikingly like
each other. Into whatsoever part of the newly discovered
lands they penetrated, they found a people seemingly
one in color, physiognomy, customs, and in mental and
social traits. Their vestiges of antiquity and their languages
presented a coincidence which was generally
observed by early travelers. Hence physical and psychological
comparisons are advanced to prove ethnological
resemblances among all the peoples of America,
and that they meanwhile possess common peculiarities
totally distinct from the nations of the old world.
Morton and his confrères, the originators of the American
homogeneity theory, even go so far as to claim for
the American man an origin as indigenous as that of
the fauna and flora. They classify all the tribes of
America, excepting only the Eskimos who wandered over
from Asia, as the American race, and divide it into the
American family and the Toltecan family. Blumenbach
classifies the Americans as a distinct species. The
American Mongolidæ of Dr Latham are divided into
Eskimos and American Indians. Dr Morton perceives
the same characteristic lineaments in the face of the
Fuegian and the Mexican, and in tribes inhabiting the
Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi Valley, and Florida.
The same osteological structure, swarthy color, straight
hair, meagre beard, obliquely cornered eyes, prominent
cheek bones, and thick lips are common to them all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Dr Latham describes his American Mongolidæ as exercising
upon the world a material rather than a moral
influence; giving them meanwhile a color, neither a true
white nor a jet black; hair straight and black, rarely
light, sometimes curly; eyes sometimes oblique; a broad,
flat face and a retreating forehead. Dr Prichard considers
the American race, psychologically, as neither
superior nor inferior to other primitive races of the
world. Bory de St Vincent classifies Americans into
five species, including the Eskimos. The Mexicans
he considers as cognate with the Malays. Humboldt
characterizes the nations of America as one race, by
their straight glossy hair, thin beard, swarthy complexion,
and cranial formation. Schoolcraft makes four
groups; the first extending across the northern end of
the continent; the second, tribes living east of the Mississippi;
the third, those between the Mississippi and the
Rocky Mountains; and the fourth, those west of the
Rocky Mountains. All these he subdivides into thirty-seven
families; but so far as those on the Pacific Coast
are concerned, he might as reasonably have made of
them twice or half the number.</p>

<p>All writers agree in giving to the nations of America
a remote antiquity; all admit that there exists a greater
uniformity between them than is to be found in
the old world; many deny that all are one race.
There is undoubtedly a prevailing uniformity in those
physical characteristics which govern classification; but
this uniformity goes as far to prove one universal race
throughout the world, as it does to prove a race peculiar
to America. Traditions, ruins, moral and physical peculiarities,
all denote for Americans a remote antiquity.
The action of a climate peculiar to America, and of
natural surroundings common to all the people of the
continent, could not fail to produce in time a similarity
of physiological structure.</p>

<p class="sidenote">INDIVIDUALITY OF RACE.</p>

<p>The impression of a New World individuality of race
was no doubt strengthened in the eyes of the Conquerors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and in the mind of the train of writers that followed, by
the fact, that the newly discovered tribes were more like
each other than were any other peoples they had ever
before seen; and at the same time very much unlike any
nation whatever of the old world. And so any really
existing physical distinctions among the American stocks
came to be overlooked or undervalued. Darwin, on the
authority of Elphinstone, observes that in India, "although
a newly arrived European cannot at first distinguish
the various native races, yet they soon appear to
him entirely dissimilar; and the Hindoo cannot at first
perceive any difference between the several European
nations."</p>

<p>It has been observed by Prof. von Martius that the literary
and architectural remains of the civilized tribes of
America indicate a higher degree of intellectual elevation
than is likely to be found in a nation emerging
from barbarism. In their sacerdotal ordinances, privileged
orders, regulated despotisms, codes of law, and
forms of government are found clear indications of a
relapse from civilization to barbarism. Chateaubriand,
from the same premises, develops a directly opposite
conclusion, and perceives in all this high antiquity and
civilization only a praiseworthy evolution from primeval
barbarism.</p>

<p>Thus arguments drawn from a comparison of parallel
traits in the moral, social, or physical condition of man
should be received with allowance, for man has much in
common not only with man, but with animals. Variations
in bodily structure and mental faculties are governed
by general laws. The great variety of climate
which characterizes America could not fail to produce
various habits of life. The half-torpid Hyperborean,
the fierce warrior-hunter of the vast interior forests, the
sluggish, swarthy native of the tropics, and the intelligent
Mexican of the table-land, slowly developing into
civilization under the refining influences of arts and
letters,&mdash;all these indicate variety in the unity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
American race; while the insulation of American nations,
and the general characteristics incident to peculiar
physical conditions could not fail to produce a unity in
their variety.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RACES OF THE PACIFIC.</p>

<p>The races of the Pacific States embrace all the varieties
of species known as American under any of the
classifications mentioned. Thus, in the five divisions
of Blumenbach, the Eskimos of the north would come
under the fourth division, which embraces Malays and
Polynesians, and which is distinguished by a high
square skull, low forehead, short broad nose, and projecting
jaws. To his fifth class, the American, which
he subdivides into the American family and the Toltecan
family, he gives a small skull with a high apex,
flat on the occiput, high cheek bones, receding forehead,
aquiline nose, large mouth, and tumid lips. Morton,
although he makes twenty-two divisions in all, classifies
Americans in the same manner. The Polar family he
characterises as brown in color, short in stature, of thick,
clumsy proportions, with a short neck, large head, flat
face, small nose, and eyes disposed to obliquity. He
perceives an identity of race among all the other stocks
from Mount St Elias to Patagonia; though he designates
the semi-civilized tribes of Mexico and Peru as the
Toltecan family, and the savage nations as the Appalachian
branch of the American family. Dr Prichard
makes three divisions of the tribes bordering the Pacific
between Mount St Elias and Cape St Lucas: the tribes
from the borders of the Eskimos southward to Vancouver
Island constitute the first division; the tribes
of Oregon and Washington, the second; and the tribes
of Upper and Lower California, the third. Pickering
assigns the limits of the American, Malay, or Toltecan
family to California and western Mexico. He is of the
opinion that they crossed from southeastern Asia by way
of the islands of the Pacific, and landed upon this continent
south of San Francisco, there being no traces of
them north of this point; while the Mongolians found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
their way from northeastern Asia across Bering Strait.
The Californians, therefore, he calls Malays; and the
inhabitants of Vancouver Island, British Columbia,
Washington, and Oregon, he classifies as Mongolians.
Californians, in the eyes of this traveler, differ from
their northern neighbors in complexion and physiognomy.
The only physiological test that Mr Pickering
was able to apply in order to distinguish the Polynesian in
San Francisco from the native Californian, was that
the hair of the former was wavy, while that of the latter
was straight. Both have more hair than the Oregonian.
The skin of the Malay of the Polynesian Islands,
and that of the Californian are alike, soft and very
dark. Three other analogous characteristics were discovered
by Mr Pickering. Both have an open countenance,
one wife, and no tomahawk! On the other hand,
the Mongolian from Asia, and the Oregonian are of a
lighter complexion, and exhibit the same general resemblances
that are seen in the American and Asiatic Eskimos.</p>

<p>In general the Toltecan family may be described as of
good stature, well proportioned, rather above medium size,
of a light copper color; as having long black obliquely
pointed eyes, regular white teeth, glossy black hair, thin
beard, prominent cheek bones, thick lips, large aquiline
nose, and retreating forehead. A gentle expression about
the mouth is blended with severity and melancholy in
the upper portion of the face. They are brave, cruel
in war, sanguinary in religion, and revengeful. They
are intelligent; possess minds well adapted to the pursuit
of knowledge; and, at the time of the arrival of the
Spaniards, were well advanced in history, architecture,
mathematics, and astronomy. They constructed
aqueducts, extracted metals, carved images in gold,
silver, and copper; they could spin, weave, and dye;
they could accurately cut precious stones; they cultivated
corn and cotton; built large cities, constructing
their buildings of stone and lime; made roads and
erected stupendous tumuli.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Certain ethnological zones have been observed by
some, stretching across the continent in various latitudes,
broken somewhat by intersecting continental elevations,
but following for the most part isothermal lines which,
on coming from the east, bend northward as the softer
air of the Pacific is entered. Thus the Eskimos nearly
surround the pole. Next come the Tinneh, stretching
across the continent from the east, somewhat irregularly,
but their course marked generally by thermic
lines, bending northward after crossing the Rocky
Mountains, their southern boundary, touching the Pacific,
about the fifty-fifth parallel. The Algonkin family
border on the Tinneh, commencing at the mouth of the
St Lawrence River, and extending westward to the
Rocky Mountains. Natural causes alone prevent the
extension of these belts round the entire earth. Indeed,
both philologists and physiologists trace lines of
affinity across the Pacific, from island to island, from
one continent to the other; one line, as we have seen,
crossing Bering Strait, another following the Aleutian
Archipelago, and a third striking the coast south of San
Francisco Bay.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SAVAGE HUMANITY.</p>

<p>It is common for those unaccustomed to look below
the surface of things, to regard Indians as scarcely
within the category of humanity. Especially is this the
case when we, maddened by some treacherous outrage,
some diabolic act of cruelty, hastily pronounce them
incorrigibly wicked, inhumanly malignant, a nest of
vipers, the extermination of which is a righteous act.
All of which may be true; but, judged by this standard,
has not every nation on earth incurred the death
penalty? Human nature is in no wise changed by culture.
The European is but a white-washed savage. Civilized
venom is no less virulent than savage venom. It ill
becomes the full grown man to scoff at the ineffectual
attempts of the little child, and to attempt the cure of
its faults by killing it. No more is it a mark of benevolent
wisdom in those favored by a superior intelligence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
with the written records of the past from which
to draw experience and learn how best to shape their
course for the future, to cry down the untaught man of
the wilderness, deny him a place in this world or the
next, denounce him as a scourge, an outlaw, and seize
upon every light pretext to assist him off the stage from
which his doom is so rapidly removing him. We view
man in his primitive state from a wrong stand-point at
the outset. In place of regarding savages as of one
common humanity with ourselves, and the ancestors
perhaps of peoples higher in the scale of being, and
more intellectual than any the world has yet seen, we
place them among the common enemies of mankind, and
regard them more in the light of wild animals than of
wild men.</p>

<p>And let not him who seeks a deeper insight into the
mysteries of humanity despise beginnings, things crude
and small. The difference between the cultured and the
primitive man lies chiefly in the fact that one has a few
centuries the start of the other in the race of progress.
Before condemning the barbarian, let us first examine
his code of ethics. Let us draw our light from his
light, reason after his fashion; see in the sky, the earth,
the sea, the same fantastic imagery that plays upon his
fancy, and adapt our sense of right and wrong to his
social surroundings. Just as human nature is able to
appreciate divine nature only as divine nature accords
with human nature; so the intuitions of lower orders of
beings can be comprehended only by bringing into play our
lower faculties. Nor can we any more clearly appreciate
the conceptions of beings below us than of those above
us. The thoughts, reasonings, and instincts of an animal
or insect are as much a mystery to the human intellect
as are the lofty contemplations of an archangel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PACIFICATION OF TIERRA FIRME.</p>
<p>Three hundred and thirty-six years were occupied in the discovery of the
western border of North America. From the time when, in 1501, the adventurous
notary of Triana, Rodrigo de Bastidas, approached the Isthmus of
Darien, in search of gold and pearls, till the year 1837, when Messrs Dease and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Simpson, by order of the Hudson's Bay Company, completed the survey of the
northern extremity, which bounds the Arctic Ocean, the intervening territory
was discovered at intervals, and under widely different circumstances. During
that time, under various immediate incentives, but with the broad principle
of avarice underlying all, such parts of this territory as were conceived
to be of sufficient value were seized, and the inhabitants made a prey to the
rapacity of the invaders. Thus the purpose of the worthy notary Bastidas,
the first Spaniard who visited the continent of North America, was pacific
barter with the Indians; and his kind treatment was rewarded by a successful
traffic. Next came Columbus, from the opposite direction, sailing southward
along the coast of Honduras on his fourth voyage, in 1502. His was
the nobler object of discovery. He was striving to get through or round
this <i>tierra firme</i> which, standing between himself and his theory, persistently
barred his progress westward. He had no time for barter, nor any inclination
to plant settlements; he was looking for a strait or passage through
or round these outer confines to the more opulent regions of India. But,
unsuccessful in his laudable effort, he at length yielded to the clamorous
cupidity of his crew. He permitted his brother, the Adelantado, to land and
take possession of the country for the king of Spain, and, in the year following,
to attempt a settlement at Veragua.</p>
<p class="sidenote">FIRST INTERCOURSE WITH EUROPEANS.</p>

<p>In 1506-8, Juan de Solis with Pinzon continued the search of Columbus,
along the coast of Yucatan and Mexico, for a passage through to the southern
ocean. The disastrous adventures of Alonzo de Ojeda, Diego de Nicuesa, and
Juan de la Cosa, on the Isthmus of Darien, between the years 1507 and 1511,
brought into more intimate contact the steel weapons of the chivalrous
hidalgos with the naked bodies of the savages. Vasco Nuñez de Balboa,
after a toilsome journey across the Isthmus in 1513, was rewarded by the
first view of the Pacific Ocean, of which he took possession for the king
of Spain on the twenty-fifth of September. The white sails of Córdova
Grijalva, and Garay, descried by the natives of Yucatan and Mexico in
1517-19, were quickly followed by Cortés and his keen-scented band of
adventurers, who, received by the unsuspecting natives as gods, would have
been dismissed by them as fiends had not the invasion culminated in the
conquest of Mexico. During the years 1522-24, Cortés made expeditions to
Tehuantepec, Panuco, and Central America; Gil Gonzales and Cristobal de
Olid invaded Nicaragua and Honduras. Nuño de Guzman in 1530, with a
large force, took possession of the entire northern country from the city of
Mexico to the northern boundary of Sinaloa; and Cabeza de Vaca crossed
the continent from Texas to Sinaloa in the years 1528-36. Journeys to the
north were made by Cortés, Ulloa, Coronado, Mendoza, and Cabrillo between
the years 1536 and 1542. Hundreds of Roman Catholic missionaries, ready
to lay down their lives in their earnest anxiety for the souls of the Indians,
spread out into the wilderness in every direction. During the latter part of
the sixteenth century had place,&mdash;the expedition of Francisco de Ibarra to
Sinaloa in 1556, the campaign of Hernando de Bazan against the Indians
of Sinaloa in 1570, the adventures of Oxenham in Darien in 1575, the voyage
round the world of Sir Francis Drake, touching upon the Northwest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Coast in 1579; the expedition of Antonio de Espejo to New Mexico in 1583;
Francisco de Gali's return from Macao to Mexico, by way of the Northwest
Coast, in 1584; the voyage of Maldonado to the imaginary Straits of Anian in
1588; the expedition of Castaño de Sosa to New Mexico in 1590; the voyage of
Juan de Fuca to the Straits of Anian in 1592; the wreck of the 'San Agustin'
upon the Northwest Coast in 1595; the voyage of Sebastian Vizcaino towards
California in 1596; the discoveries of Juan de Oñate in New Mexico in 1599, and
many others. Intercourse with the natives was extended during the seventeenth
century by the voyage of Sebastian Vizcaino from Mexico to California
in 1602; by the expedition of Francisco de Ortega to Lower California
in 1631; by the journey of Thomas Gage from Mexico to Guatemala in 1638;
by the voyage round the world of William Dampier in 1679; by the reckless
adventures of the Buccaneers from 1680 to 1690; by the expedition of Isidor
de Otondo into Lower California in 1683; by the expedition of Father Kino
to Sonora and Arizona in 1683; by the expeditions of Kino, Kappus, Mange,
Bernal, Carrasco, Salvatierra, and others to Sonora and Arizona in 1694-9;
and by the occupation of Lower California by the Jesuits, Salvatierra,
Ugarte, Kino, and Piccolo, from 1697 to 1701. Voyages of circumnavigation
were made by Dampier in 1703-4; by Rogers in 1708-11; by Shelvocke in
1719-22, and by Anson in 1740-4. Frondac made a voyage from China to
California in 1709.</p>

<p>The first voyage through Bering Strait is supposed to have been made
by Semun Deschneff and his companions in the year 1648, and purports to
have explored the Asiatic coast from the river Kolyma to the south of the
river Anadir, thus proving the separation of the continents of Asia and America.
In 1711, a Russian Cossack, named Popoff, was sent from the fort
on the Anadir river to subdue the rebellious Tschuktschi of Tschuktschi
Noss, a point of land on the Asiatic coast near to the American
continent. He there received from the natives the first intelligence of the
proximity of the continent of America and the character of the inhabitants;
an account of which will be given in another place. In 1741, Vitus Bering
and Alexei Tschirikoff sailed in company, from Petropaulovski, for the opposite
coast of America. They parted company during a storm, the latter
reaching the coast in latitude fifty-six, and the former landing at Cape St
Elias in latitude sixty degrees north. The earliest information concerning
the Aleutian Islanders was obtained by the Russians in the year 1745, when
Michael Nevodtsikoff sailed from the Kamtchatka river in pursuit of furs.
A Russian commercial company, called the Promyschleniki, was formed, and
other hunting and trading voyages followed. Lasareff visited six islands of
the Andreanovski group in 1761; and the year following was made the discovery
of the Alaskan Peninsula, supposed to be an island until after the
survey of the coast by Captain Cook. Drusinin made a hunting expedition
to Unalaska and the Fox Islands in 1763; and, during the same year, Stephen
Glottoff visited the island of Kadiak. Korovin, Solovieff, Synd, Otseredin,
Krenitzen, and other Russian fur-hunters spent the years 1762-5 among the
Aleutian Islands, capturing sea-otters, seals, and foxes, and exchanging, with
the natives, beads and iron utensils, for furs.

<p class="sidenote">OCCUPATION OF CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>A grand missionary movement, growing out of the religious rivalries
of the two great orders of the Catholic Church, led to the original occupation
of Upper California by Spaniards. The work of Christianizing Lower
California was inaugurated by the Jesuits, under Fathers Salvatierra and
Kino, in 1697. When the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767, their
missions were turned over to the Franciscans. This so roused the zeal of the
Dominicans that they immediately appealed to Spain, and in 1769 obtained
an edict, giving them a due share in the missions of Lower California. The
Franciscans, thinking it better to carry their efforts into new fields than to
contend for predominance at home, generously offered to cede the whole of
Lower California to the Dominicans, and themselves retire to the wild and
distant regions of Upper California. This being agreed upon, two expeditions
were organized to proceed northward simultaneously, one by water
and the other by land. In January, 1769, the ship 'San Carlos,' commanded
by Vicente Vila, was dispatched for San Diego, followed by the 'San Antonio,'
under Juan Perez, and the 'San José,' which was unfortunately lost. The
land expedition was separated into two divisions; the first under Rivera y
Moncada departed from Mexico in March, and arrived at San Diego in May;
the second under Gaspar de Portolá and Father Junípero Serra reached
San Diego in July, 1769. Portolá with his companions immediately set out
by land for the Bay of Monterey; but, unwittingly passing it by, they continued
northward until barred in their progress by the magnificent Bay of
San Francisco. Unable to find the harbor of Monterey, they returned to
San Diego in January, 1770. In April, Portolá made a second and more
successful attempt, and arrived at Monterey in May. Meanwhile Perez and
Junípero Serra accomplished the voyage by sea, sailing in the 'San
Carlos.' In 1772, Pedro Fages and Juan Crespi proceeded from Monterey to
explore the Bay of San Francisco. They were followed by Rivera y Moncada
in 1774, and Palou and Ezeta in 1775; and in 1776, Moraga founded
the Mission of Dolores. In 1775, Bodega y Quadra voyaged up the
Californian coast to the fifty-eighth parallel. In 1776, Dominguez and Escalante
made an expedition from Santa Fé to Monterey. Menonville journeyed
to Oajaca in New Spain in 1777. In 1778, Captain Cook, in his
third voyage round the world, touched along the Coast from Cape Flattery
to Norton Sound; and in 1779, Bodega y Quadra, Maurelle, and Arteaga
voyaged up the western coast to Mount St Elias. During the years 1785-8,
voyages of circumnavigation were made by Dixon and Portlock, and by La
Pérouse, all touching upon the Northwest Coast.</p>

<p>French Canadian traders were the first to penetrate the northern interior
west of Hudson Bay. Their most distant station was on the Saskatchewan
River, two thousand miles from civilization, in the heart of an unknown
wilderness inhabited by savage men and beasts. These <i>coureurs des bois</i> or
wood-rangers, as they were called, were admirably adapted, by their disposition
and superior address, to conciliate the Indians and form settlements
among them. Unrestrained, however, by control, they committed excesses
which the French government could check only by prohibiting, under penalty
of death, any but its authorized agents from trading within its territories.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
British merchants at New York soon entered into competition with the fur
princes of Montreal. But, in 1670, a more formidable opposition arose in the
organization of the Hudson's Bay Company, by Prince Rupert and other
noblemen, under a charter of Charles II. which granted exclusive right to all
the territory drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay. Notwithstanding
constant feuds with the French merchants regarding territorial limits, the
company prospered from the beginning, paying annual dividends of twenty-five
and fifty per cent. after many times increasing the capital stock. In
1676, the Canadians formed the <i>Compagnie du Nord</i>, in order the more successfully
to resist encroachment. Upon the loss of Canada by the French in
1762, hostilities thickened between the companies, and the traffic for a time
fell off. In 1784, the famous Northwest Company was formed by Canadian
merchants, and the management entrusted to the Frobisher brothers
and Simon M'Tavish. The head-quarters of the company were at Montreal,
but annual meetings were held, with lordly state, at Fort William, on the
shore of Lake Superior. The company consisted of twenty-three partners,
and employed over two thousand clerks and servants. It exercised an almost
feudal sway over a wide savage domain, and maintained a formidable competition
with the Hudson's Bay Company, with which they were for two
years in actual war. In 1813, they purchased, from the partners of John
Jacob Astor, the settlement of Astoria on the Columbia River. In 1821, they
united with the Hudson's Bay Company; and the charter covering the entire
region occupied by both was renewed by act of Parliament. In 1762, some
merchants of New Orleans organized a company which was commissioned
by D'Abadie, director-general of Louisiana, under the name of Pierre Ligueste
Laclède, Antoine Maxan, and Company. Their first post occupied the
spot upon which the city of St Louis is now situated; and, under the auspices
of the brothers Chouteau, they penetrated northwestward beyond the Rocky
Mountains. In 1808, the Missouri Fur Company was formed at St Louis,
consisting of the Chouteaus and others; and an expedition under Major
Henry was sent across the Rocky Mountains, which established the first post
on the Columbia River. Between the years 1825 and 1830, the Rocky Mountain
Fur Company of St Louis extended their operations over California and
Oregon, but at a loss of the lives of nearly one half of their employés.
John Jacob Astor embarked in the fur trade at New York in 1784, purchasing
at that time in Montreal. In 1808, he obtained a charter for the American Fur
Company, which was, in 1811, merged into the Southwest Company. In 1809,
Mr Astor conceived the project of establishing a transcontinental line of
posts. His purpose was to concentrate the fur trade of the United States,
and establish uninterrupted communication between the Pacific and the Atlantic.
He made proposals of association to the Northwest Company, which
were not only rejected, but an attempt was made by that association to anticipate
Mr Astor in his operations, by making a settlement at the mouth of the
Columbia River. In 1810, the Pacific Fur Company was founded by Mr
Astor, and an expedition dispatched overland by way of St Louis and the
Missouri River. At the same time a vessel was sent round Cape Horn to
the mouth of the Columbia; but, their adventure in that quarter proving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
unsuccessful, the company was dissolved, and the operations of Mr Astor
were thereafter confined to the territory east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE GREAT NORTHWEST.</p>

<p>Samuel Hearne, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Company, was the first
European to reach the Arctic Ocean through the interior of the continent.
He descended Coppermine River to its mouth in the year 1771. The Upper
Misinipi River was first visited by Joseph Frobisher in 1775. Three years
later, one Peter Pond penetrated to within thirty miles of Athabasca Lake,
and established a trading post at that point. Four canoe-loads of merchandise
were exchanged by him for more fine furs than his canoes could carry.
Other adventurous traders soon followed; but not long afterwards the inevitable
broils which always attended the early intercourse of Europeans and
Indians, rose to such a height that, but for the appearance of that terrible
scourge, the small-pox, the traders would have been extirpated. The
ravages of this dire disease continued to depopulate the country until
1782, when traders again appeared among the Knisteneaux and Tinneh.
The most northern division of the Northwest Company was at that time
the Athabascan Lake region, where Alexander Mackenzie was the managing
partner. His winter residence was at Fort Chipewyan, on Athabasca
Lake. The Indians who traded at his establishment informed him of the
existence of a large river flowing to the westward from Slave Lake. Thinking
thereby to reach the Pacific Ocean, Mr Mackenzie, in the year 1789, set
out upon an expedition to the west; and, descending the noble stream which
bears his name, found himself, contrary to his expectations, upon the shores
of the Arctic Sea. In 1793, he made a journey to the Pacific, ascending
Peace River, and reaching the coast in latitude about fifty-two. The first
expedition organized by the British government for the purpose of surveying
the northern coast, was sent out under Lieutenants Franklin and Parry in
1819. During the year following, Franklin descended Coppermine River, and
subsequently, in 1825, he made a journey down the Mackenzie. In 1808,
D. W. Harmon, a partner in the Northwest Company, crossed the Rocky
Mountains, at about the fifty-sixth parallel, to Fraser and Stuart Lakes.
The accounts of the natives given by these travelers and their companions
are essentially the same, and later voyagers have failed to throw much additional
light upon the subject. John Meares, in 1788, visited the Straits of
Fuca, Nootka Sound, and Cook Inlet; and, during the same year, two ships,
sent out by Boston merchants, under Robert Gray and John Kendrick,
entered Nootka Sound. Estevan Martinez and Gonzalo Haro, sent from
Mexico to look after the interest of Spain in these regions, explored Prince
William Sound, and visited Kadiak. During the same year, the Russians
established a trading post at Copper River. In 1789, Joseph Billings visited
the Aleutian Islands, and the Boston vessels explored the Eastern coast of
Queen Charlotte Island. In 1790, Salvador Fidalgo was sent by the Mexican
government to Nootka; and Monaldo explored the Straits of Juan de Fuca.
In 1791, four ships belonging to Boston merchants, two Spanish ships, one
French and several Russian vessels touched upon the Northwest Coast. The
Spanish vessels were under the command of Alejandro Malespina; Etienne Marchand
was the commander of the French ship. The 'Sutil y Mexicana' entered

Nootka Sound in 1792; and during the same year, Vancouver commenced
his explorations along the coast above Cape Flattery. In 1803-4, Baron Von
Humboldt was making his searching investigations in Mexico; while the
captive New Englander, Jewett, was dancing attendance to Maquina, king
of the Nootkas. Lewis and Clark traversed the continent in 1805. In 1806,
a Mr Fraser set out from Canada, and crossed the Rocky Mountains near
the headwaters of the river which bears his name. He descended Fraser
River to the lake which he also called after himself. There he built a fort
and opened trade with the natives. Kotzebue visited the coast in 1816; and
the Russian expedition under Kramchenko, Wasilieff, and Etolin, in 1822.
Captain Morrel explored the Californian coast from San Diego to San Francisco
in 1825; Captains Beechey and Lütke, the Northwest Coast in 1826; and
Sir Edward Belcher in 1837. J. K. Townsend made an excursion west of the
Rocky Mountains in 1834. In 1837, Dease and Simpson made an open
boat voyage from the Mackenzie River, westward to Point Barrow, the farthest
point made by Beechey from the opposite direction, thus reaching the
<i>Ultima Thule</i> of northwestern discovery. Sir George Simpson crossed the
continent in 1841, Fremont in 1843, and Paul Kane in 1845. Kushevaroff
visited the coast in 1838, Laplace in 1839, Commodore Wilkes in 1841, and
Captain Kellett in 1849. Following the discovery of gold, the country was deluged
by adventurers. In 1853-4, commenced the series of explorations for a
Pacific railway. The necessities of the natives were examined, and remnants
of disappearing nations were collected upon reservations under government
agents. The interior of Alaska was first penetrated by the employés of the
Russian-American Fur Company. Malakoff ascended the Yukon in 1838;
and, in 1842, Derabin established a fort upon that river. In 1849, W. H.
Hooper made a boat expedition from Kotzebue Sound to the Mackenzie
River; and, in 1866, William H. Dall and Frederick Whymper ascended the
Yukon.</p>

<p>I have here given a few only of the original sources whence my information
is derived concerning the Indians. A multitude of minor voyages and
travels have been performed during the past three and a half centuries, and
accounts published by early residents among the natives, the bare enumeration
of which I fear would prove wearisome to the reader. Enough, however,
has been given to show the immediate causes which led to the discovery
and occupation of the several parts of this western coast. The Spanish
cavaliers craved from the Indians of the South their lands and their gold.
The Spanish missionaries demanded from the Indians of Northern Mexico
and California, faith. The French, English, Canadian, and American fur
companies sought from the Indians of Oregon and New Caledonia, peltries.
The Russians compelled the natives of the Aleutian Islands to hunt sea-animals.
The filthy raw-flesh-eating Eskimos, having nothing wherewith to
tempt the cupidity of the superior race, retain their primitive purity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CUPIDITY AND ZEAL.</p>

<p>We observe then three original incentives urging on civilized white
men to overspread the domain of the Indian. The first was that thirst
for gold, which characterized the fiery hidalgos from Spain in their conquests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and to obtain which no cruelty was too severe nor any sacrifice of
human life too great; as though of all the gifts vouchsafed to man, material
or divine, one only was worth possessing. The second, following closely
in the footsteps of the first, and oftentimes constituting a part of it, was
religious enthusiasm; a zealous interest in the souls of the natives and the
form in which they worshiped. The third, which occupied the attention of
other and more northern Europeans, grew out of a covetous desire for
the wild man's clothing; to secure to themselves the peltries of the great
hyperborean regions of America. From the south of Europe the Spaniards
landed in tropical North America, and exterminated the natives. From the
north of Europe the French, English, and Russians crossed over to the
northern part of America; and, with a kinder and more refined cruelty, no
less effectually succeeded in sweeping them from the face of the earth by the
introduction of the poisonous elements of a debased cultivation.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Indians of the north, it was contrary to the interests
of white people to kill them in order to obtain the skins of their animals;
for, with a few trinkets, they could procure what otherwise would require
long and severe labor to obtain. The policy, therefore, of the great fur-trading
companies has been to cherish the Indians as their best hunters, to
live at peace with them, to heal their ancient feuds, and to withhold from
them intoxicating liquors. The condition of their women, who were considered
by the natives as little better than beasts, has been changed by their inter-social
relations with the servants of the trading companies; and their more
barbarous practices discontinued. It was the almost universal custom of the
employés of the Hudson's Bay Company to unite to themselves native
women; thus, by means of this relationship, the condition of the women has
been raised, while the men manifest a kinder feeling towards the white race
who thus in a measure become one with them.</p>

<p>The efforts of early missionaries to this region were not crowned with that
success which attended the Spaniards in their spiritual warfare upon the southern
nations, from the fact that no attention was paid to the temporal necessities
of the natives. It has long since been demonstrated impossible to reach
the heart of a savage through abstract ideas of morality and elevation of character.
A religion, in order to find favor in his eyes, must first meet some
of his material requirements. If it is good, it will clothe him better
and feed him better, for this to him is the chiefest good in life. Intermixtures
of civilized with savage peoples are sure to result in the total disappearance
of refinement on the one side, or in the extinction of the barbaric race on
the other. The downward path is always the easiest. Of all the millions
of native Americans who have perished under the withering influences of
European civilization, there is not a single instance on record, of a tribe or
nation having been reclaimed, ecclesiastically or otherwise, by artifice and
argument. Individual savages have been educated with a fair degree of success.
But, with a degree of certainty far greater, no sooner is the white man
freed from the social restraint of civilized companionship, than he immediately
tends towards barbarism; and not infrequently becomes so fascinated
with his new life as to prefer it to any other. Social development is inherent:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
superinduced culture is a failure. Left alone, the nations of America might
have unfolded into as bright a civilization as that of Europe. They were
already well advanced, and still rapidly advancing towards it, when they
were so mercilessly stricken down. But for a stranger to re-create the heart
or head of a red man, it were easier to change the color of his skin.</p>

<p>I shall attempt to describe the physical and mental
characteristics of the Native Races of the Pacific States
under seven distinctive groups; namely, I. Hyperboreans,
being those nations whose territory lies north of
the fifty-fifth parallel; II. Columbians, who dwell between
the fifty-fifth and forty-second parallels, and
whose lands to some extent are drained by the Columbia
River and its tributaries; III. Californians, and the Inhabitants
of the Great Basin; IV. New Mexicans,
including the nations of the Colorado River and northern
Mexico; V. Wild Tribes of Mexico; VI. Wild Tribes of
Central America; VII. Civilized Nations of Mexico and
Central America. It is my purpose, without any attempt
at ethnological classification, or further comment concerning
races and stocks, plainly to portray such customs
and characteristics as were peculiar to each people at the
time of its first intercourse with European strangers;
leaving scientists to make their own deductions, and
draw specific lines between linguistic and physiological
families, as they may deem proper. I shall endeavor to
picture these nations in their aboriginal condition, as seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
by the first invaders, as described by those who beheld
them in their savage grandeur, and before they were
startled from their lair by the treacherous voice of civilized
friendship. Now they are gone,&mdash;those dusky denizens
of a thousand forests,&mdash;melted like hoar-frost before the
rising sun of a superior intelligence; and it is only from
the earliest records, from the narratives of eye witnesses,
many of them rude unlettered men, trappers, sailors,
and soldiers, that we are able to know them as they
were. Some division of the work into parts, however
arbitrary it may be, is indispensable. In dealing
with Mythology, and in tracing the tortuous course
of Language, boundaries will be dropped and beliefs
and tongues will be followed wherever they lead; but in
describing Manners and Customs, to avoid confusion,
territorial divisions are necessary.</p>

<p class="sidenote">GROUPINGS AND SUBDIVISIONS.</p>

<p>In the groupings which I have adopted, one cluster of
nations follows another in geographical succession; the
dividing line not being more distinct, perhaps, than that
which distinguishes some national divisions, but sufficiently
marked, in mental and physical peculiarities, to
entitle each group to a separate consideration.</p>

<p>The only distinction of race made by naturalists, upon
the continents of both North and South America, until
a comparatively recent period, was by segregating the
first of the above named groups from all other people of
both continents, and calling one Mongolians and the
other Americans. A more intimate acquaintance with
the nations of the North proves conclusively that one
of the boldest types of the American Indian proper, the
Tinneh, lies within the territory of this first group,
conterminous with the Mongolian Eskimos, and crowding
them down to a narrow line along the shore of the Arctic
Sea. The nations of the second group, although exhibiting
multitudinous variations in minor traits, are essentially
one people. Between the California Diggers of
the third division and the New Mexican Towns-people
of the fourth, there is more diversity; and a still greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
difference between the savage and civilized nations of
the Mexican table-land. Any classification or division
of the subject which could be made would be open to
criticism. I therefore adopt the most simple practical
plan, one which will present the subject most clearly to
the general reader, and leave it in the best shape for
purposes of theorizing and generalization.</p>

<p>In the first or <span class="smcap">Hyperborean</span> group, to which this chapter
is devoted, are five subdivisions, as follows: The <i>Eskimos</i>,
commonly called Western Eskimos, who skirt the
shores of the Arctic Ocean from Mackenzie River to Kotzebue
Sound; the <i>Koniagas</i> or Southern Eskimos, who, commencing
at Kotzebue Sound, cross the Kaviak Peninsula,
border on Bering Sea from Norton Sound southward,
and stretch over the Alaskan<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Peninsula and Koniagan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Islands to the mouth of the Atna or Copper River,
extending back into the interior about one hundred and
fifty miles; the <i>Aleuts</i>, or people of the Aleutian Archipelago;
the <i>Thlinkeets</i>, who inhabit the coast and islands
between the rivers Atna and Nass; and the <i>Tinneh</i>,
or Athabascas, occupying the territory between the
above described boundaries and Hudson Bay. Each of
these families is divided into nations or tribes, distinguished
one from another by slight dialectic or other
differences, which tribal divisions will be given in treating
of the several nations respectively.</p>

<p>Let us first cast a glance over this broad domain, and
mark those aspects of nature which exercise so powerful
an influence upon the destinies of mankind. Midway between
Mount St Elias and the Arctic seaboard rise three
mountain chains. One, the Rocky Mountain range, crossing
from the Yukon to the Mackenzie River, deflects southward,
and taking up its mighty line of march, throws a
barrier between the east and the west, which extends
throughout the entire length of the continent. Between
the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, interposes another
called in Oregon the Cascade Range, and in California
the Sierra Nevada; while from the same starting-point,
the Alaskan range stretches out to the southwest along
the Alaskan Peninsula, and breaks into fragments in the
Aleutian Archipelago. Three noble streams, the Mackenzie,
the Yukon, and the Kuskoquim, float the boats of the
inland Hyperboreans and supply them with food; while
from the heated waters of Japan comes a current of the
sea, bathing the icy coasts with genial warmth, tempering
the air, and imparting gladness to the oily watermen
of the coast, to the northernmost limit of their lands.
The northern border of this territory is treeless; the
southern shore, absorbing more warmth and moisture
from the Japan current, is fringed with dense forests;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
while the interior, interspersed with hills, and lakes,
and woods, and grassy plains, during the short summer
is clothed in luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the frowning aspect of nature, animal
life in the Arctic regions is most abundant. The
ocean swarms with every species of fish and sea-mammal;
the land abounds in reindeer, moose, musk-oxen; in
black, grizzly, and Arctic bears; in wolves, foxes, beavers,
mink, ermine, martin, otters, raccoons, and water-fowl.
Immense herds of buffalo roam over the bleak grassy
plains of the eastern Tinneh, but seldom venture far to
the west of the Rocky Mountains. Myriads of birds
migrate to and fro between their breeding-places in the
interior of Alaska, the open Arctic Sea, and the warmer
latitudes of the south. From the Gulf of Mexico, from
the islands of the Pacific, from the lakes of California,
of Oregon, and of Washington they come, fluttering and
feasting, to rear their young during the sparkling Arctic
summer-day.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MAN AND NATURE.</p>

<p>The whole occupation of man throughout this region,
is a struggle for life. So long as the organism is plentifully
supplied with heat-producing food, all is well.
Once let the internal fire go down, and all is ill. Unlike
the inhabitants of equatorial latitudes, where, Eden-like,
the sheltering tree drops food, and the little
nourishment essential to life may be obtained by only
stretching forth the hand and plucking it, the Hyperborean
man must maintain a constant warfare with
nature, or die. His daily food depends upon the success
of his daily battle with beasts, birds, and fishes,
which dispute with him possession of sea and land.
Unfortunate in his search for game, or foiled in his
attempt at capture, he must fast. The associate of
beasts, governed by the same emergencies, preying
upon animals as animals prey upon each other, the
victim supplying all the necessities of the victor, occupying
territory in common, both alike drawing supplies
directly from the storehouse of nature,&mdash;primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
man derives his very quality from the brute with which
he struggles. The idiosyncrasies of the animal fasten
upon him, and that upon which he feeds becomes a part
of him.</p>

<p>Thus, in a nation of hunters inhabiting a rigorous
climate, we may look for wiry, keen-scented men, who
in their war upon wild beasts put forth strength and
endurance in order to overtake and capture the strong;
cunning is opposed by superior cunning; a stealthy
watchfulness governs every movement, while the intelligence
of the man contends with the instincts of the brute.
Fishermen, on the other hand, who obtain their food
with comparatively little effort, are more sluggish in
their natures and less noble in their development. In
the icy regions of the north, the animal creation supplies
man with food, clothing, and caloric; with all the requisites
of an existence under circumstances apparently the
most adverse to comfort; and when he digs his dwelling
beneath the ground, or walls out the piercing winds with
snow, his ultimate is attained.</p>

<p>The chief differences in tribes occupying the interior
and the seaboard,&mdash;the elevated, treeless, grassy plains
east of the Rocky Mountains, and the humid islands
and shores of the great Northwest,&mdash;grow out of necessities
arising from their methods of procuring food.
Even causes so slight as the sheltering bend of a coast-line;
the guarding of a shore by islands; the breaking
of a seaboard by inlets and covering of the strand with
sea-weed and polyps, requiring only the labor of gathering;
or the presence of a bluff coast or windy promontory,
whose occupants are obliged to put forth more
vigorous action for sustenance&mdash;all govern man in his
development. Turn now to the most northern division
of our most northern group.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE ESKIMOS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Eskimos</span>, Esquimaux, or as they call themselves,
<i>Innuit</i>, 'the people,' from <i>inuk</i>, 'man,'<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> occupy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Arctic seaboard from eastern Greenland along the entire
continent of America, and across Bering<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Strait to
the Asiatic shore. Formerly the inhabitants of our
whole Hyperborean sea-coast, from the Mackenzie River
to Queen Charlotte Island&mdash;the interior being entirely
unknown&mdash;were denominated Eskimos, and were
of supposed Asiatic origin.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The tribes of southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Alaska were then found to differ essentially from those
of the northern coast. Under the name Eskimos, therefore,
I include only the Western Eskimos of certain
writers, whose southern boundary terminates at Kotzebue
Sound.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ESKIMO LAND.</p>

<p>Eskimo-land is thinly peopled, and but little is
known of tribal divisions. At the Coppermine River,
the Eskimos are called <i>Naggeuktormutes</i>, or deer-horns;
at the eastern outlet of the Mackenzie, their tribal
name is <i>Kittegarute</i>; between the Mackenzie River and
Barter Reef, they go by the name of <i>Kangmali Innuit</i>;
at Point Barrow they call themselves <i>Nuwungmutes</i>;
while on the Nunatok River, in the vicinity of Kotzebue
Sound, they are known as <i>Nunatangmutes</i>. Their villages,
consisting of five or six families each,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> are scattered
along the coast. A village site is usually selected upon
some good landing-place, where there is sufficient depth
of water to float a whale. Between tribes is left a spot
of unoccupied or neutral ground, upon which small parties
meet during the summer for purposes of trade.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Eskimos are essentially a peculiar people. Their
character and their condition, the one of necessity growing
out of the other, are peculiar. First, it is claimed
for them that they are the anomalous race of America&mdash;the
only people of the new world clearly identical with
any race of the old. Then they are the most littoral people
in the world. The linear extent of their occupancy,
all of it a narrow seaboard averaging scarcely one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
miles in width, is estimated at not less than five thousand
miles. Before them is a vast, unknown, icy ocean,
upon which they scarcely dare venture beyond sight of
land; behind them, hostile mountaineers ever ready to
dispute encroachment. Their very mother-earth, upon
whose cold bosom they have been borne, age after age
through countless generations,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is almost impenetrable,
thawless ice. Their days and nights, and seasons and
years, are not like those of other men. Six months of
day succeed six months of night. Three months of
sunless winter; three months of nightless summer; six
months of glimmering twilight.</p>

<p>About the middle of October<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> commences the long
night of winter. The earth and sea put on an icy
covering; beasts and birds depart for regions sheltered
or more congenial; humanity huddles in subterraneous
dens; all nature sinks into repose. The little heat left
by the retreating sun soon radiates out into the deep
blue realms of space; the temperature sinks rapidly to
forty or fifty degrees below freezing; the air is hushed,
the ocean calm, the sky cloudless. An awful, painful
stillness pervades the dreary solitude. Not a sound is
heard; the distant din of busy man, and the noiseless
hum of the wilderness alike are wanting. Whispers
become audible at a considerable distance, and an insupportable
sense of loneliness oppresses the inexperienced
visitor.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Occasionally the aurora borealis flashes out in
prismatic coruscations, throwing a brilliant arch from
east to west&mdash;now in variegated oscillations, graduating
through all the various tints of blue, and green, and violet,
and crimson; darting, flashing, or streaming in yellow
columns, upwards, downwards; now blazing steadily, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
in wavy undulations, sometimes up to the very zenith;
momentarily lighting up in majestic grandeur the
cheerless frozen scenery, but only to fall back with
exhausted force, leaving a denser obscurity. Nature's
electric lantern, suspended for a time in the frosty
vault of heaven;&mdash;munificent nature's fire-works;
with the polar owl, the polar bear, and the polar
man, spectators.</p>

<p>In January, the brilliancy of the stars is dimmed
perceptibly at noon; in February, a golden tint rests
upon the horizon at the same hour; in March, the
incipient dawn broadens; in April, the dozing Eskimo
rubs his eyes and crawls forth; in May, the snow
begins to melt, the impatient grass and flowers arrive
as it departs.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In June, the summer has fairly come.
Under the incessant rays of the never setting sun, the
snow speedily disappears, the ice breaks up, the glacial
earth softens for a depth of one, two, or three feet; circulation
is restored to vegetation,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which, during winter,
had been stopped,&mdash;if we may believe Sir John Richardson,
even the largest trees freezing to the heart. Sea,
and plain, and rolling steppe lay aside their seamless
shroud of white, and a brilliant tint of emerald overspreads
the landscape.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> All Nature, with one resounding
cry, leaps up and claps her hands for joy.
Flocks of birds, lured from their winter homes, fill
the air with their melody; myriads of wild fowls send
forth their shrill cries; the moose and the reindeer flock
down from the forests;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from the resonant sea comes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
noise of spouting whales and barking seals; and this so
lately dismal, cheerless region, blooms with an exhuberance
of life equaled only by the shortness of its duration.
And in token of a just appreciation of the
Creator's goodness, this animated medley&mdash;man, and
beasts, and birds, and fishes&mdash;rises up, divides, falls to,
and ends in eating or in being eaten.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.</p>

<p>The physical characteristics of the Eskimos are: a
fair complexion, the skin, when free from dirt and paint,
being almost white;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a medium stature, well proportioned,
thick-set, muscular, robust, active,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with small
and beautifully shaped hands and feet;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a pyramidal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
head;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a broad egg-shaped face; high rounded cheek-bones;
flat nose; small oblique eyes; large mouth;
teeth regular, but well worn;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> coarse black hair, closely
cut upon the crown, leaving a monk-like ring around
the edge,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and a paucity of beard.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The men frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
leave the hair in a natural state. The women
of Icy Reef introduce false hair among their own, wearing
the whole in two immense bows at the back of the
head. At Point Barrow, they separate the hair into two
parts or braids, saturating it with train-oil, and binding
it into stiff bunches with strips of skin. Their lower
extremities are short, so that in a sitting posture they
look taller than when standing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">IMPROVEMENTS UPON NATURE.</p>

<p>Were these people satisfied with what nature has
done for them, they would be passably good-looking.
But with them as with all mankind, no matter how high
the degree of intelligence and refinement attained, art
must be applied to improve upon nature. The few finishing
touches neglected by the Creator, man is ever
ready to supply.</p>

<p>Arrived at the age of puberty, the great work of improvement
begins. Up to this time the skin has been
kept saturated in grease and filth, until the natural color
is lost, and until the complexion is brought down to the
Eskimo standard. Now pigments of various dye are applied,
both painted outwardly and pricked into the skin;
holes are cut in the face, and plugs or labrets inserted.
These operations, however, attended with no little solemnity,
are supposed to possess some significance other than
that of mere ornament. Upon the occasion of piercing
the lip, for instance, a religious feast is given.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>On the northern coast the women paint the eyebrows
and tattoo the chin; while the men only pierce the lower
lip under one or both corners of the mouth, and insert
in each aperture a double-headed sleeve-button or dumb-bell-shaped
labret, of bone, ivory, shell, stone, glass, or
wood. The incision when first made is about the size
of a quill, but as the aspirant for improved beauty grows
older, the size of the orifice is enlarged until it reaches
a width of half or three quarters of an inch.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In tattooing,
the color is applied by drawing a thread under
the skin, or pricking it in with a needle. Different
tribes, and different ranks of the same tribe, have each
their peculiar form of tattooing. The plebeian female of
certain bands is permitted to adorn her chin with but
one vertical line in the centre, and one parallel to it on
either side, while the more fortunate noblesse mark two
vertical lines from each corner of the mouth.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> A feminine
cast of features, as is common with other branches of
the Mongolian race, prevails in both sexes. Some travelers
discover in the faces of the men a characteristic
expression of ferociousness, and in those of the women,
an extraordinary display of wantonness. A thick coating
of filth and a strong odor of train-oil are inseparable
from an Eskimo, and the fashion of labrets adds in no
wise to his comeliness.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ESKIMO DRESS.</p>

<p>For covering to the body, the Eskimos employ the
skin of all the beasts and birds that come within their
reach. Skins are prepared in the fur,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and cut and
sewed with neatness and skill. Even the intestines of
seals and whales are used in the manufacture of water-proof
overdresses.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The costume for both sexes consists
of long stockings or drawers, over which are breeches
extending from the shoulders to below the knees; and
a frock or jacket, somewhat shorter than the breeches
with sleeves and hood. This garment is made whole,
there being no openings except for the head and arms.
The frock of the male is cut at the bottom nearly
square, while that of the female reaches a little lower,
and terminates before and behind in a point or scollop.
The tail of some animal graces the hinder part of
the male frock; the woman's has a large hood, in which
she carries her infant. Otherwise both sexes dress
alike; and as, when stripped of their facial decorations,
their physiognomies are alike, they are not unfrequently
mistaken one for the other.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They have boots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of walrus or seal skin, mittens or gloves of deer-skin,
and intestine water-proofs covering the entire body.
Several kinds of fur frequently enter into the composition
of one garment. Thus the body of the frock,
generally of reindeer-skin, may be of bird, bear, seal,
mink, or squirrel skin; while the hood may be of fox-skin,
the lining of hare-skin, the fringe of wolverine-skin,
and the gloves of fawn-skin.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Two suits are
worn during the coldest weather; the inner one with
the fur next the skin, the outer suit with the fur outward.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Thus, with their stomachs well filled with fat,
and their backs covered with furs, they bid defiance to
the severest Arctic winter.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS OF THE ESKIMOS.</p>

<p>In architecture, the Eskimo is fully equal to the
emergency; building, upon a soil which yields him little
or no material, three classes of dwellings. Penetrating
the frozen earth, or casting around him a frozen wall,
he compels the very elements from which he seeks
protection to protect him. For his <i>yourt</i> or winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
residence he digs a hole of the required dimensions,
to a depth of about six feet.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Within this excavation
he erects a frame, either of wood or whalebone,
lashing his timbers with thongs instead of nailing them.
This frame is carried upward to a distance of two or three
feet above the ground,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> when it is covered by a dome-shaped
roof of poles or whale-ribs turfed and earthed
over.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In the centre of the roof is left a hole for the
admission of light and the emission of smoke. In absence
of fire, a translucent covering of whale-intestine
confines the warmth of putrifying filth, and completes the
Eskimo's sense of comfort. To gain admittance to this
snug retreat, without exposing the inmates to the storms
without, another and a smaller hole is dug to the same
depth, a short distance from the first. From one to
the other, an underground passage-way is then opened,
through which entrance is made on hands and knees.
The occupants descend by means of a ladder, and over the
entrance a shed is erected, to protect it from the snow.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Within the entrance is hung a deer-skin door, and anterooms
are arranged in which to deposit frozen outer garments
before entering the heated room. Around the
sides of the dwelling, sleeping-places are marked out; for
bedsteads, boards are placed upon logs one or two feet in
diameter, and covered with willow branches and skins.
A little heap of stones in the centre of the room, under
the smoke-hole, forms the fireplace. In the corners of
the room are stone lamps, which answer all domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
purposes in the absence of fire-wood.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In the better class
of buildings, the sides and floor are boarded. Supplies
are kept in a store house at a little distance from the
dwelling, perched upon four posts, away from the reach
of the dogs, and a frame is always erected on which
to hang furs and fish. Several years are sometimes
occupied in building a hut.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Mark how nature supplies this treeless coast with
wood. The breaking-up of winter in the mountains of
Alaska is indeed a breaking-up. The accumulated
masses of ice and snow, when suddenly loosened by the
incessant rays of the never-setting sun, bear away all
before them. Down from the mountain-sides comes
the avalanche, uprooting trees, swelling rivers, hurrying
with its burden to the sea. There, casting itself
into the warm ocean current, the ice soon disappears,
and the driftwood which accompanied it is carried northward
and thrown back upon the beach by the October
winds. Thus huge forest-trees, taken up bodily, as it
were, in the middle of a continent, and carried by the
currents to the incredible distance, sometimes, of three
thousand miles, are deposited all along the Arctic seaboard,
laid at the very door of these people, a people
whose store of this world's benefits is none of the most
abundant.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> True, wood is not an absolute necessity with
them, as many of their houses in the coldest weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
have no fire; only oil-lamps being used for cooking
and heating. Whale-ribs supply the place of trees for
house and boat timbers, and hides are commonly used
for boards. Yet a bountiful supply of wood during their
long, cold, dark winter comes in no wise amiss.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Their
summer tents are made of seal or untanned deer skins
with the hair outward, conical or bell-shaped, and without
a smoke-hole as no fires are ever kindled within them.
The wet or frozen earth is covered with a few coarse
skins for a floor.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SNOW HOUSES.</p>

<p>But the most unique system of architecture in America
is improvised by the Eskimos during their seal-hunting
expeditions upon the ice, when they occupy a veritable
crystal palace fit for an Arctic fairy. On the frozen
river or sea, a spot is chosen free from irregularities,
and a circle of ten or fifteen feet in diameter
drawn on the snow. The snow within the
circle is then cut into slabs from three to four
inches in thickness, their length being the depth
of the snow, and these slabs are formed into a
wall enclosing the circle and carried up in courses
similar to those of brick or stone, terminating in a
dome-shaped roof. A wedge-like slab keys the arch;
and this principle in architecture may have first been
known to the Assyrians, Egyptians, Chinese or Eskimos.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Loose snow is then thrown into the crevices,
which quickly congeals; an aperture is cut in the
side for a door; and if the thin wall is not sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
translucent, a piece of ice is fitted into the side
for a window. Seats, tables, couches, and even fireplaces
are made with frozen snow, and covered with
reindeer or seal skin. Out-houses connect with the
main room, and frequently a number of dwellings are
built contiguously, with a passage from one to another.
These houses are comfortable and durable, resisting
alike the wind and the thaw until late in the season.
Care must be taken that the walls are not so thick as to
make them too warm, and so cause a dripping from the
interior. A square block of snow serves as a stand for
the stone lamp which is their only fire.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>"The purity of the material," says Sir John Franklin,
who saw them build an edifice of this kind at
Coppermine River, "of which the house was framed,
the elegance of its construction, and the translucency of
its walls, which transmitted a very pleasant light, gave
it an appearance far superior to a marble building, and
one might survey it with feelings somewhat akin to
those produced by the contemplation of a Grecian temple,
reared by Phidias; both are triumphs of art, inimitable
in their kind."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Eskimos, fortunately, have not a dainty palate. Everything
which sustains life is food for them. Their
substantials comprise the flesh of land and marine animals,
fish and birds; venison, and whale and seal
blubber being chief. Choice dishes, tempting to the
appetite, Arctic epicurean dishes, Eskimo nectar and
ambrosia, are daintily prepared, hospitably placed before
strangers, and eaten and drunk with avidity. Among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
them are: a bowl of coagulated blood, mashed cranberries
with rancid train-oil, whortleberries and walrus-blubber,
alternate streaks of putrid black and white whale-fat;
venison steeped in seal-oil, raw deer's liver cut in small
pieces and mixed with the warm half-digested contents of
the animal's stomach; bowls of live maggots, a draught of
warm blood from a newly killed animal.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Fish are sometimes
eaten alive. Meats are kept in seal-skin bags for
over a year, decomposing meanwhile, but never becoming
too rancid for our Eskimos. Their winter store of oil
they secure in seal-skin bags, which are buried in the
frozen ground. Charlevoix remarks that they are the
only race known who prefer food raw. This, however, is
not the case. They prefer their food cooked, but do not
object to it raw or rotten. They are no lovers of salt.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MIGRATIONS FOR FOOD.</p>

<p>In mid-winter, while the land is enveloped in darkness,
the Eskimo dozes torpidly in his den. Early in
September the musk-oxen and reindeer retreat southward,
and the fish are confined beneath the frozen covering
of the rivers. It is during the short summer,
when food is abundant, that they who would not perish
must lay up a supply for the winter. When spring
opens, and the rivers are cleared of ice, the natives follow
the fish, which at that time ascend the streams to spawn,
and spear them at the falls and rapids that impede their
progress. Small wooden fish are sometimes made and
thrown into holes in the ice for a decoy; salmon are
taken in a whalebone seine. At this season also reindeer
are captured on their way to the coast, whither
they resort in the spring to drop their young. Multitudes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of geese, ducks, and swans visit the ocean during
the same period to breed.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>August and September are the months for whales.
When a whale is discovered rolling on the water, a
boat starts out, and from the distance of a few feet a
weapon is plunged into its blubbery carcass. The harpoons
are so constructed that when this blow is given,
the shaft becomes disengaged from the barbed ivory point.
To this point a seal-skin buoy or bladder is attached by
means of a cord. The blows are repeated; the buoys encumber
the monster in diving or swimming, and the ingenious
Eskimo is soon able to tow the carcass to the shore.
A successful chase secures an abundance of food for the
winter.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Seals are caught during the winter, and considerable
skill is required in taking them. Being a warm-blooded
respiratory animal, they are obliged to have
air, and in order to obtain it, while the surface of the
water is undergoing the freezing process, they keep open
a breathing-hole by constantly gnawing away the ice.
They produce their young in March, and soon afterward
the natives abandon their villages and set out on the
ice in pursuit of them. Seals, like whales, are also
killed with a harpoon to which is attached a bladder.
The seal, when struck, may draw the float under water
for a time, but is soon obliged to rise to the surface
from exhaustion and for air, when he is again attacked
and soon obliged to yield.</p>

<p>The Eskimos are no less ingenious in catching wild-fowl,
which they accomplish by means of a sling or net
made of woven sinews, with ivory balls attached. They
also snare birds by means of whalebone nooses, round
which fine gravel is scattered as a bait. They man&oelig;uvre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
reindeer to near the edge of a cliff, and, driving
them into the sea, kill them from canoes. They also
waylay them at the narrow passes, and capture them in
great numbers. They construct large reindeer pounds,
and set up two diverging rows of turf so as to represent
men; the outer extremities of the line being sometimes
two miles apart, and narrowing to a small enclosure.
Into this trap the unsuspecting animals are driven, when
they are easily speared.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BEAR-HUNTING.</p>

<p>To overcome the formidable polar bear the natives
have two strategems. One is by imitating the seal, upon
which the bear principally feeds, and thereby enticing it
within gunshot. Another is by bending a piece of stiff
whalebone, encasing it in a ball of blubber, and freezing
the ball, which then holds firm the bent whalebone.
Armed with these frozen blubber balls, the natives approach
their victim, and, with a discharge of arrows, open
the engagement. The bear, smarting with pain, turns
upon his tormentors, who, taking to their heels, drop
now and then a blubber ball. Bruin, as fond of food
as of revenge, pauses for a moment, hastily swallows
one, then another, and another. Soon a strange sensation
is felt within. The thawing blubber, melted by the
heat of the animal's stomach, releases the pent-up whalebone,
which, springing into place, plays havoc with the
intestines, and brings the bear to a painful and ignominious
end. To vegetables, the natives are rather indifferent;
berries, acid sorrel leaves, and certain roots, are
used as a relish. There is no native intoxicating liquor,
but in eating they get gluttonously stupid.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his long, frigid, biting winter, the
Eskimo never suffers from the cold so long as he has an
abundance of food. As we have seen, a whale or a moose
supplies him with food, shelter, and raiment. With an
internal fire, fed by his oily and animal food, glowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
in his stomach, his blood at fever heat, he burrows
comfortably in ice and snow and frozen ground,
without necessity for wood or coal.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Nor are those passions
which are supposed to develop most fully under a
milder temperature, wanting in the half-frozen Hyperborean.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
One of the chief difficulties of the Eskimo
during the winter is to obtain water, and the women
spend a large portion of their time in melting snow over
oil-lamps. In the Arctic regions, eating snow is attended
with serious consequences. Ice or snow, touched
to the lips or tongue, blisters like caustic. Fire is obtained
by striking sparks from iron pyrites with quartz.
It is a singular fact that in the coldest climate inhabited
by man, fire is less used than anywhere else in the world,
equatorial regions perhaps excepted. Caloric for the
body is supplied by food and supplemented by furs.
Snow houses, from their nature, prohibit the use of
fire; but cooking with the Eskimo is a luxury, not a
necessity. He well understands how to utilize every
part of the animals so essential to his existence. With
their skins he clothes himself, makes houses, boats, and
oil-bags; their flesh and fat he eats. He even devours
the contents of the intestines, and with the skin makes
water-proof clothing. Knives, arrow-points, house, boat,
and sledge frames, fish-hooks, domestic utensils, ice-chisels,
and in fact almost all their implements, are made from the
horns and bones of the deer, whale, and seal. Bowstrings
are made of the sinews of musk-oxen, and ropes
of seal-skin.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The Eskimo's arms are not very formidable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Backed by his ingenuity, they nevertheless prove sufficient
for practical purposes; and while his neighbor
possesses none better, all are on an equal footing in
war. Their most powerful as well as most artistic
weapon is the bow. It is made of beech or spruce,
in three pieces curving in opposite directions and ingeniously
bound by twisted sinews, so as to give the
greatest possible strength. Richardson affirms that
"in the hands of a native hunter it will propel an
arrow with sufficient force to pierce the heart of a
musk-ox, or break the leg of a reindeer." Arrows, as
well as spears, lances, and darts, are of white spruce,
and pointed with bone, ivory, flint, and slate.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> East
of the Mackenzie, copper enters largely into the composition
of Eskimo utensils.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Before the introduction
of iron by Europeans, stone hatchets were common.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SLEDGES, SNOW-SHOES, AND BOATS.</p>

<p>The Hyperboreans surpass all American nations in their
facilities for locomotion, both upon land and water. In
their skin boats, the natives of the Alaskan seaboard from
Point Barrow to Mount St Elias, made long voyages,
crossing the strait and sea of Bering, and held commercial
intercourse with the people of Asia. Sixty miles is an
ordinary day's journey for sledges, while Indians on
snow-shoes have been known to run down and capture
deer. Throughout this entire border, including
the Aleutian Islands, boats are made wholly of the
skins of seals or sea-lions, excepting the frame of wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
or whale-ribs. In the interior, as well as on the coast
immediately below Mount St Elias, skin boats disappear,
and canoes or wooden boats are used.</p>

<p>Two kinds of skin boats are employed by the natives
of the Alaskan coast, a large and a small one. The
former is called by the natives <i>oomiak</i>, and by the Russians
<i>baidar</i>. This is a large, flat-bottomed, open boat;
the skeleton of wood or whale-ribs, fastened with seal-skin
thongs or whale's sinews, and covered with oiled
seal or sea-lion skins, which are first sewed together
and then stretched over the frame. The baidar is
usually about thirty feet in length, six feet in extreme
breadth, and three feet in depth. It is propelled by
oars, and will carry fifteen or twenty persons, but its
capacity is greatly increased by lashing inflated seal-skins
to the outside. In storms at sea, two or three
baidars are sometimes tied together.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The small boat
is called by the natives <i>kyak</i>, and by the Russians <i>baidarka</i>.
It is constructed of the same material and in
the same manner as the baidar, except that it is entirely
covered with skins, top as well as bottom, save one hole
left in the deck, which is filled by the navigator. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
taking his seat, and thereby filling this hole, the occupant
puts on a water-proof over-dress, the bottom of
which is so secured round the rim of the hole that not
a drop of water can penetrate it. This dress is provided
with sleeves and a hood. It is securely fastened
at the wrists and neck, and when the hood is drawn over
the head, the boatman may bid defiance to the water.
The baidarka is about sixteen feet in length, and two
feet in width at the middle, tapering to a point at either
end.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It is light and strong, and when skillfully handled
is considered very safe. The native of Norton
Sound will twirl his kyak completely over, turn an
aquatic somersault, and by the aid of his double-bladed
paddle come up safely on the other side, without even
losing his seat. So highly were these boats esteemed
by the Russians, that they were at once universally
adopted by them in navigating these waters. They
were unable to invent any improvement in either of
them, although they made a baidarka with two and
three seats, which they employed in addition to the
one-seated kyak. The Kadiak baidarka is a little
shorter and wider than the Aleutian.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Sleds, sledges, dogs, and Arctic land-boats play an
important part in Eskimo economy. The Eskimo sled
is framed of spruce, birch, or whalebone, strongly bound
with thongs, and the runners shod with smooth strips of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
whale's jaw-bone. This sled is heavy, and fit only for
traveling over ice or frozen snow. Indian sleds of the
interior are lighter, the runners being of thin flexible
boards better adapted to the inequalities of the ground.
Sledges, such as are used by the voyagers of Hudson
Bay, are of totally different construction. Three boards,
each about one foot in width and twelve feet in length,
thinned, and curved into a semicircle at one end, are
placed side by side and firmly lashed together with
thongs. A leathern bag or blanket of the full size of
the sled is provided, in which the load is placed and
lashed down with strings.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Sleds and sledges are
drawn by dogs, and they will carry a load of from a
quarter to half a ton, or about one hundred pounds
to each dog. The dogs of Alaska are scarcely up to
the average of Arctic canine nobility.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> They are of
various colors, hairy, short-legged, with large bushy
tails curved over the back; they are wolfish, suspicious,
yet powerful, sagacious, and docile, patiently performing
an incredible amount of ill-requited labor. Dogs are
harnessed to the sledge, sometimes by separate thongs at
unequal distances, sometimes in pairs to a single line.
They are guided by the voice accompanied by a whip,
and to the best trained and most sagacious is given the
longest tether, that he may act as leader. An eastern
dog will carry on his back a weight of thirty pounds.
The dogs of the northern coast are larger and stronger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
than those of the interior. Eskimo dogs are used in
hunting reindeer and musk-oxen, as well as in drawing
sledges.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Those at Cape Prince of Wales appear to be
of the same species as those used upon the Asiatic coast
for drawing sledges.</p>

<p>Snow-shoes, or foot-sledges, are differently made according
to the locality. In traveling over soft snow
they are indispensable. They consist of an open light
wooden frame, made of two smooth pieces of wood each
about two inches wide and an inch thick; the inner
part sometimes straight, and the outer curved out to
about one foot in the widest part. They are from two
to six feet in length, some oval and turned up in front,
running to a point behind; others flat, and pointed at
both ends, the space within the frame being filled with a
network of twisted deer-sinews or fine seal-skin.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The
Hudson Bay snow-shoe is only two and a half feet in
length. The Kutchin shoe is smaller than that of the
Eskimo.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PROPERTY.</p>

<p>The merchantable wealth of the Eskimos consists of
peltries, such as wolf, deer, badger, polar-bear, otter, hare,
musk-rat, Arctic-fox, and seal skins; red ochre, plumbago,
and iron pyrites; oil, ivory, whalebone; in short, all parts
of all species of beasts, birds, and fishes that they can secure
and convert into an exchangeable shape.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The articles
they most covet are tobacco, iron, and beads. They
are not particularly given to strong drink. On the shore
of Bering Strait the natives have constant commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
intercourse with Asia. They cross easily in their
boats, carefully eluding the vigilance of the fur company.
They frequently meet at the Gwosdeff Islands,
where the Tschuktschi bring tobacco, iron, tame-reindeer
skins, and walrus-ivory; the Eskimos giving in
exchange wolf and wolverine skins, wooden dishes, seal-skins
and other peltries. The Eskimos of the American
coast carry on quite an extensive trade with the Indians
of the interior,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> exchanging with them Asiatic merchandise
for peltries. They are sharp at bargains, avaricious,
totally devoid of conscience in their dealings; will sell
their property thrice if possible, and, if caught, laugh it
off as a joke. The rights of property are scrupulously
respected among themselves, but to steal from strangers,
which they practice on every occasion with considerable
dexterity, is considered rather a mark of merit than
otherwise. A successful thief, when a stranger is the
victim, receives the applause of the entire tribe.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Captain
Kotzebue thus describes the manner of trading
with the Russo-Indians of the south and of Asia.</p>

<p>"The stranger first comes, and lays some goods on
the shore and then retires; the American then comes,
looks at the things, puts as many things near them as
he thinks proper to give, and then also goes away.
Upon this the stranger approaches, and examines what
is offered him; if he is satisfied with it, he takes the
skins and leaves the goods instead; but if not, then he
lets all the things lie, retires a second time, and expects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
an addition from the buyer." If they cannot agree,
each retires with his goods.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SOCIAL ECONOMY.</p>

<p>Their government, if it can be called a government,
is patriarchal. Now and then some ancient or able
man gains an ascendency in the tribe, and overawes
his fellows. Some tribes even acknowledge an
hereditary chief, but his authority is nominal. He can
neither exact tribute, nor govern the movements of the
people. His power seems to be exercised only in treating
with other tribes. Slavery in any form is unknown
among them. Caste has been mentioned in connection
with tattooing, but, as a rule, social distinctions do not
exist.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">AMUSEMENTS.</p>

<p>The home of the Eskimo is a model of filth and freeness.
Coyness is not one of their vices, nor is modesty
ranked among their virtues. The latitude of innocency
marks all their social relations; they refrain from doing
in public nothing that they would do in private. Female
chastity is little regarded. The Kutchins, it is said, are
jealous, but treat their wives kindly; the New Caledonians
are jealous, and treat them cruelly; but the
philosophic Eskimos are neither jealous nor unkind.
Indeed, so far are they from espionage or meanness in
marital affairs, that it is the duty of the hospitable host
to place at the disposal of his guest not only the house
and its contents, but his wife also.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The lot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
women is but little better than slavery. All the work,
except the nobler occupations of hunting, fishing, and
fighting, falls to them. The lesson of female inferiority
is at an early age instilled into the mind of
youth. Nevertheless, the Eskimo mother is remarkably
affectionate, and fulfills her low destiny with patient
kindness. Polygamy is common; every man being
entitled to as many wives as he can get and maintain.
On the other hand, if women are scarce, the men
as easily adapt themselves to circumstances, and two
of them marry one woman. Marriages are celebrated
as follows: after gaining the consent of the mother, the
lover presents a suit of clothes to the lady, who arrays
herself therein and thenceforth is his wife.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Dancing,
accompanied by singing and violent gesticulation, is their
chief amusement. In all the nations of the north, every
well-regulated village aspiring to any degree of respectability
has its public or town house, which among the
Eskimos is called the <i>Casine</i> or <i>Kashim</i>. It consists of
one large subterranean room, better built than the common
dwellings, and occupying a central position, where
the people congregate on feast-days.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This house is
also used as a public work-shop, where are manufactured
boats, sledges, and snow-shoes. A large portion
of the winter is devoted to dancing. Feasting and visiting
commence in November. On festive occasions, a
dim light and a strong odor are thrown over the scene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
by means of blubber-lamps. The dancers, who are
usually young men, strip themselves to the waist, or
even appear <i>in puris naturalibus</i>, and go through numberless
burlesque imitations of birds and beasts, their
gestures being accompanied by tambourine and songs.
Sometimes they are fantastically arrayed in seal or
deer skin pantaloons, decked with dog or wolf tails
behind, and wear feathers or a colored handkerchief on
the head. The ancients, seated upon benches which encircle
the room, smoke, and smile approbation. The
women attend with fish and berries in large wooden
bowls; and, upon the opening of the performance, they
are at once relieved of their contributions by the actors,
who elevate the provisions successively to the four cardinal
points and once to the skies above, when all partake
of the feast. Then comes another dance. A monotonous
refrain, accompanied by the beating of an instrument
made of seal-intestines stretched over a circular frame,
brings upon the ground one boy after another, until
about twenty form a circle. A series of pantomimes then
commences, portraying love, jealousy, hatred, and friendship.
During intervals in the exercises, presents are
distributed to strangers. In their national dance, one
girl after another comes in turn to the centre, while the
others join hands and dance and sing, not unmusically,
about her. The most extravagant motions win the
greatest applause.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Among other customs of the Eskimo may be mentioned
the following. Their salutations are made by
rubbing noses together. No matter how oily the skin,
nor how rank the odor, he who would avoid offense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
must submit his nose to the nose of his Hyperborean
brother,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and his face to the caressing hand of his polar
friend. To convey intimations of friendship at a distance,
they extend their arms, and rub and pat their breast.
Upon the approach of visitors they form a circle, and sit
like Turks, smoking their pipes. Men, women, and children
are inordinately fond of tobacco. They swallow
the smoke and revel in a temporary elysium. They are
called brave, simple, kind, intelligent, happy, hospitable,
respectful to the aged. They are also called cruel, ungrateful,
treacherous, cunning, dolorously complaining,
miserable.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They are great mimics, and, in order to
terrify strangers, they accustom themselves to the most
extraordinary contortions of features and body. As a
measure of intellectual capacity, it is claimed for
them that they divide time into days, lunar months,
seasons, and years; that they estimate accurately by the
sun or stars the time of day or night; that they can
count several hundred and draw maps. They also
make rude drawings on bone, representing dances, deer-hunting,
animals, and all the various pursuits followed
by them from the cradle to the grave.</p>

<p>But few diseases are common to them, and a deformed
person is scarcely ever seen. Cutaneous eruptions, resulting
from their antipathy to water, and ophthalmia,
arising from the smoke of their closed huts and the glare
of sun-light upon snow and water, constitute their chief
disorders.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> For protection to their eyes in hunting and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
fishing, they make goggles by cutting a slit in a piece of
soft wood, and adjusting it to the face.</p>

<p>The Eskimos do not, as a rule, bury their dead; but
double the body up, and place it on the side in a plank
box, which is elevated three or four feet from the
ground, and supported by four posts. The grave-box is
often covered with painted figures of birds, fishes, and
animals. Sometimes it is wrapped in skins, placed upon
an elevated frame, and covered with planks, or trunks of
trees, so as to protect it from wild beasts. Upon the
frame or in the grave-box are deposited the arms,
clothing, and sometimes the domestic utensils of the
deceased. Frequent mention is made by travelers of
burial places where the bodies lie exposed, with their
heads placed towards the north.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE KONIAGAS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Koniagas</span> derive their name from the inhabitants
of the island of Kadiak, who, when first discovered,
called themselves <i>Kanagist</i>.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> They were confounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
by early Russian writers with the Aleuts. English
ethnologists sometimes call them Southern Eskimos.
From Kadiak they extend along the coast in both directions;
northward across the Alaskan Peninsula to
Kotzebue Sound, and eastward to Prince William Sound.
The Koniagan family is divided into nations as follows:
the <i>Koniagas</i> proper, who inhabit the Koniagan
Archipelago; the <i>Chugatshes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> who occupy the
islands and shores of Prince William Sound; the <i>Aglegmutes</i>,
of Bristol Bay; the <i>Keyataigmutes</i>, who live upon
the river Nushagak and the coast as far as Cape Newenham;
the <i>Agulmutes</i>, dwelling upon the coast between
the Kuskoquim and Kishunak rivers; the <i>Kuskoquigmutes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
occupying the banks of the river Kuskoquim;
the <i>Magemutes</i>, in the neighborhood of Cape Romanzoff;
the <i>Kwichpagmutes</i>, <i>Kwichluagmutes</i>, and <i>Pashtoliks</i>, on
the Kwichpak, Kwickluak, and Pashtolik rivers; the
<i>Chnagmutes</i>, near Pashtolik Bay; the <i>Anlygmutes</i>, of Golovnin
Bay, and the <i>Kaviaks</i> and <i>Malemutes</i>, of Norton
Sound.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> "All of these people," says Baron von Wrangell,
"speak one language and belong to one stock."</p>

<p>The most populous district is the Kuskoquim Valley.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The small islands in the vicinity of Kadiak were once
well peopled; but as the Russians depopulated them, and
hunters became scarce, the natives were not allowed to
scatter, but were forced to congregate in towns.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Schelikoff,
the first settler on Kadiak, reported, in that and
contiguous isles, thirty thousand natives. Thirty years
later, Saritsheff visited the island and found but three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
thousand. The Chugatshes not long since lived upon
the island of Kadiak, but, in consequence of dissensions
with their neighbors, they were obliged to emigrate and
take up their residence on the main land. They derived
their manners originally from the northern nations;
but, after having been driven from their ancient possessions,
they made raids upon southern nations, carried
off their women, and, from the connections thus formed,
underwent a marked change. They now resemble the
southern rather than the northern tribes. The Kadiaks,
Chugatshes, Kuskoquims, and adjacent tribes, according
to their own traditions, came from the north, while
the Unalaskas believe themselves to have originated in
the west. The Kaviaks intermingle to a considerable
extent with the Malemutes, and the two are often taken
for one people; but their dialects are quite distinct.</p>

<p class="sidenote">LAND OF THE KONIAGAS.</p>

<p>The country of the Koniagas is a rugged wilderness,
into many parts of which no white man has ever penetrated.
Mountainous forests, glacial cañons, down which
flow innumerable torrents, hills interspersed with lakes
and marshy plains; ice-clad in winter, covered with
luxuriant vegetation in summer. Some sheltered inlets
absorb an undue proportion of oceanic warmth. Thus
the name Aglegmutes signifies the inhabitants of a
warm climate.</p>

<p>Travelers report chiefs among the Koniagas seven
feet in height, but in general they are of medium
stature.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Their complexion may be a shade darker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
than that of the Eskimos of the northern coast, but it is
still very light.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The Chugatshes are remarkable for
their large heads, short necks, broad faces, and small
eyes. Holmberg claims for the Koniagas a peculiar
formation of the skull; the back, as he says, being not
arched but flat. They pierce the septum of the nose and
the under lip, and in the apertures wear ornaments of
various materials; the most highly prized being of shell
or of amber. It is said that at times amber is thrown
up in large quantities by the ocean, on the south side of
Kadiak, generally after a heavy earthquake, and that
at such times it forms an important article of commerce
with the natives. The more the female chin is riddled
with holes, the greater the respectability. Two
ornaments are usually worn, but by very aristocratic
ladies as many as six.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Their favorite colors in face-painting
are red and blue, though black and leaden
colors are common.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Young Kadiak wives secure the
affectionate admiration of their husbands by tattooing
the breast and adorning the face with black lines; while
the Kuskoquim women sew into their chin two parallel
blue lines. The hair is worn long by men as well as
women. On state occasions, it is elaborately dressed;
first saturated in train-oil, then powdered with red clay
or oxide of iron, and finished off with a shower of white
feathers. Both sexes wear beads wherever they can
find a place for them, round the neck, wrists, and ankles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
besides making a multitude of holes for them in the
ears, nose, and chin. Into these holes they will also
insert buttons, nails, or any European trinket which
falls into their possession.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">KADIAK AND KUSKOQUIM DRESS.</p>

<p>The aboriginal dress of a wealthy Kadiak was a bird-skin
parka, or shirt, fringed at the top and bottom, with
long wide sleeves out of which the wearer slipped his
arms in an emergency. This garment was neatly sewed
with bird-bone needles, and a hundred skins were sometimes
used in the making of a single parka. It was
worn with the feathers outside during the day, and inside
during the night. Round the waist was fastened
an embroidered girdle, and over all, in wet weather, was
worn an intestine water-proof coat. The Kadiak breeches
and stockings were of otter or other skins, and the boots,
when any were worn, were of seal-neck leather, with
whale-skin soles. The Russians in a measure prohibited
the use of furs among the natives, compelling them
to purchase woolen goods from the company, and deliver
up all their peltries. The parkas and stockings of the
Kuskoquims are of reindeer-skin, covered with embroidery,
and trimmed with valuable furs. They also
make stockings of swamp grass, and cloaks of sturgeon-skin.
The Malemute and Kaviak dress is similar to
that of the northern Eskimo.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>The Chugatshes, men, women, and children, dress
alike in a close fur frock, or robe, reaching sometimes
to the knees, but generally to the ankles. Their feet
and legs are commonly bare, notwithstanding the high
latitude in which they live; but they sometimes wear
skin stockings and mittens. They make a truncated
conic hat of straw or wood, in whimsical representation
of the head of some fish or bird, and garnished with
colors.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS AND FOOD OF THE KONIAGAS.</p>

<p>The Koniagas build two kinds of houses; one a large,
winter village residence, called by the Russians <i>barabara</i>,
and the other a summer hunting-hut, placed usually upon
the banks of a stream whence they draw food. Their
winter houses are very large, accommodating three or four
families each. They are constructed by digging a square
space of the required area to a depth of two feet, placing
a post, four feet high above the surface of the ground, at
every corner, and roofing the space over to constitute a
main hall, where eating is done, filth deposited, and
boats built. The sides are of planks, and the roof of
boards, poles, or whale-ribs, thickly covered with grass.
In the roof is a smoke-hole, and on the eastern side a
door-hole about three feet square, through which entrance
is made on hands and knees, and which is protected
by a seal or other skin. Under the opening in
the roof, a hole is dug for fire; and round the sides of
the room, tomb-like excavations are made, or boards put
up, for sleeping-places, where the occupant reposes on his
back with his knees drawn up to the chin. Adjoining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
rooms are sometimes made, with low underground passages
leading off from the main hall. The walls are adorned
with implements of the chase and bags of winter food;
the latter of which, being in every stage of decay, emits an
odor most offensive to unhabituated nostrils. The ground
is carpeted with straw. When the smoke-hole is covered
by an intestine window, the dwellings of the Koniagas
are exceedingly warm, and neither fire nor clothing is required.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
The <i>kashim</i>, or public house of the Koniagas,
is built like their dwellings, and is capable of accommodating
three or four hundred people.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Huts are built by
earthing over sticks placed in roof-shape; also by erecting
a frame of poles, and covering it with bark or skins.</p>

<p>The Koniagas will eat any digestible substance in
nature except pork; from which fact Kingsborough might
have proven incontestably a Jewish origin. I should
rather give them swinish affinities, and see in this singularity
a hesitancy to feed upon the only animal, except
themselves, which eats with equal avidity bear's excrements,
carrion birds, maggoty fish, and rotten sea-animals.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
When a whale is taken, it is literally stripped
of everything to the bare bones, and these also are
used for building huts and boats.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> These people can dispose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
of enormous quantities of food; or, if necessary,
they can go a long time without eating.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Before the
introduction of intoxicating drinks by white men, they
made a fermented liquor from the juice of raspberries
and blueberries. Tobacco is in general use, but chewing
and snuffing are more frequent than smoking. Salmon
are very plentiful in the vicinity of Kadiak, and
form one of the chief articles of diet. During their
periodical ascension of the rivers, they are taken in
great quantities by means of a pole pointed with bone or
iron. Salmon are also taken in nets made of whale-sinews.
Codfish are caught with a bone hook. Whales
approach the coast of Kadiak in June, when the inhabitants
pursue them in baidarkas. Their whale-lance is
about six feet in length, and pointed with a stone upon
which is engraved the owner's mark. This point separates
from the handle and is left in the whale's flesh,
so that when the body is thrown dead upon the beach,
the whaler proves his property by his lance-point.
Many superstitions are mentioned in connection with
the whale-fishery. When a whaler dies, the body is
cut into small pieces and distributed among his fellow-craftsmen,
each of whom, after rubbing the point of his
lance upon it, dries and preserves his piece as a sort of
talisman. Or the body is placed in a distant cave, where,
before setting out upon a chase, the whalers all congregate,
take it out, carry it to a stream, immerse it and
then drink of the water. During the season, whalers
bear a charmed existence. No one may eat out of the
same dish with them, nor even approach them. When
the season is over, they hide their weapons in the
mountains.</p>

<p>In May, the Koniagas set out in two-oared baidarkas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
for distant islands, in search of sea-otter. As success
requires a smooth sea, they can hunt them only during
the months of May and June, taking them in the manner
following. Fifty or one hundred boats proceed
slowly through the water, so closely together that it is
impossible for an otter to escape between them. As soon
as the animal is discovered, the signal is given, the
area within which he must necessarily rise to the surface
for air, is surrounded by a dozen boats, and when he
appears upon the surface he is filled with arrows. Seals
are hunted with spears ten or twelve feet in length, upon
the end of which is fastened an inflated bladder, in order
to float the animal when dead.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE KUSKOKWIGMUTES AND MALEMUTES.</p>

<p>The Kuskokwigmutes are less nomadic than their
neighbors; being housed in permanent settlements during
the winter, although in summer they are obliged to
scatter in various directions in quest of food. Every
morning before break of day, during the hunting-season,
a boy lights the oil-lamps in all the huts of the village,
when the women rise and prepare the food. The men,
excepting old men and boys, all sleep in the kashim,
whither they retire at sunset. In the morning they
are aroused by the appearance of the shamán, arrayed
in his sacerdotal robes, and beating his sacred drum.
After morning worship, the women carry breakfast to
their husbands in the kashim. At day-break the men
depart for their hunting or fishing, and when they return,
immediately repair to the kashim, leaving the
women to unload and take care of the products of the
day's work. During the hunting-season the men visit
their wives only during the night, returning to the
kashim before daylight.</p>

<p>The Malemutes leave their villages upon the coast
regularly in February, and, with their families, resort to
the mountains, where they follow the deer until snow
melts, and then return to catch water-fowl and herring,
and gather eggs upon the cliffs and promontories of
the coast and islands. In July is their salmon feast.
The fawns of reindeer are caught upon the hills by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
women in August, either by chasing them down or
by snaring them. Deer are stalked, noosed in snares,
or driven into enclosures, where they are easily
killed. At Kadiak, hunting begins in February, and in
April they visit the smaller islands for sea-otter, seals,
sea-lions, and eggs. Their whale and other fisheries
commence in June and continue till October, at which
time they abandon work and give themselves up to
festivities. The seal is highly prized by them for its
skin, blubber, and oil. One method of catching seals
illustrates their ingenuity. Taking an air-tight seal-skin,
they blow it up like a bladder, fasten to it a long
line, and, concealing themselves behind the rocks, they
throw their imitation seal among the live ones and draw
it slowly to the shore. The others follow, and are
speared or killed with bow and arrows. Blueberries and
huckleberries are gathered in quantities and dried for
winter use; they are eaten mixed with seal-oil. The
Koniagas are also very fond of raw reindeer-fat. They
hunt with guns, and snare grouse, marten, and hares.
A small white fish is taken in great quantities from
holes in the ice. They are so abundant and so easily
caught that the natives break off the barbs from their
fish-hooks in order to facilitate their operations.</p>

<p>The white polar bear does not wander south of the
sixty-fifth parallel, and is only found near Bering Strait.
Some were found on St Matthew Island, in Bering Sea,
but were supposed to have been conveyed thither upon
floating ice. The natives approach the grizzly bear with
great caution. When a lair is discovered, the opening
is measured, and a timber barricade constructed, with an
aperture through which the bear may put his head. The
Indians then quietly approach and secure their timbers
against the opening of the den with stones, and throw a
fire-brand into the den to arouse the animal, who thereupon
puts his head out through the hole and meets
with a reception which brings him to an untimely end.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR, IMPLEMENTS, AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>In former times, the Koniagas went to war behind a
huge wooden shield a foot thick and twelve feet in
width. It was made of three thicknesses of larch-wood,
bound together with willows, and with it they covered
thirty or forty lancers.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> They poisoned their arrow and
lance points with a preparation of aconite, by drying and
pulverizing the root, mixing the powder with water, and,
when it fermented, applying it to their weapons.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> They
made arrow-points of copper, obtaining a supply from
the Kenai of Copper River;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and the wood was as finely
finished as if turned in a lathe.</p>

<p>The boats of the Koniagas are similar to those of the
north, except that the bow and stem are not alike, the
one turning up to a point and the other cut off square.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Needles made of birds' bones, and thread from whale-sinews,
in the hands of a Kadiak woman, produced
work, "many specimens of which," says Lisiansky,
"would do credit to our best seamstresses."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> They
produced fire by revolving with a bow-string a hard dry
stick upon a soft dry board, one end of the stick being
held in a mouth-piece of bone or ivory. Their implements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
were few&mdash;a stone adze, a shell or flint knife, a
polishing stone, and a handled tooth.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Yet they excel
in carving, and in working walrus-teeth and whalebone,
the former being supplied them mostly by the Aglegmutes
of the Alaskan Peninsula. The tools used in
these manufactures were of stone, and the polishing tools
of shell. Traces of the stone age are found in lamps,
hammers and cutting instruments, wedges and hatchets.
Carving is done by the men, while the women are no less
skillful in sewing, basket-making, crocheting, and knitting.
The women tan, and make clothing and boat-covers
from skins and intestines.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The Agulmutes are skilled
in the carving of wood and ivory; the Kuskoquims
excel in wood and stone carving. They make in this
manner domestic utensils and vases, with grotesque representations
of men, animals, and birds, in relief.</p>

<p>Authority is exercised only by heads of households,
but chiefs may, by superior ability, acquire much influence.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Before they became broken up and demoralized
by contact with civilization, there was a marked division
of communities into castes; an hereditary nobility and
commonalty. In the former was embodied all authority;
but the rule of American chieftains is nowhere of a
very arbitrary character. Slavery existed to a limited
extent, the thralls being mostly women and children.
Their male prisoners of war, they either killed immediately
or reserved to torture for the edification and
improvement of their children.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Upon the arrival of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the Russians, the slaves then held by the natives, thinking
to better their condition, left their barbaric masters
and placed themselves under the protection of the new
comers. The Russians accepted the trust, and set them
to work. The poor creatures, unable to perform the
imposed tasks, succumbed; and, as their numbers were
diminished by ill treatment, their places were supplied
by such of the inhabitants as had been guilty of some
misdemeanor; and singularly enough, misdemeanors
happened to be about in proportion to the demand for
slaves.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MORALITY OF THE KONIAGAS.</p>

<p>The domestic manners of the Koniagas are of the
lowest order. In filth they out-do, if possible, their
neighbors of the north.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Thrown together in little
bands under one roof, they have no idea of morality,
and the marriage relation sits so loosely as hardly to
excite jealousy in its abuse. Female chastity is deemed
a thing of value only as men hold property in it. A
young unmarried woman may live uncensured in the
freest intercourse with the men; though, as soon as
she belongs to one man, it is her duty to be true
to him. Sodomy is common; the Kaviaks practice
polygamy and incest; the Kadiaks cohabit promiscuously,
brothers and sisters, parents and children.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
The Malemutes are content with one wife, but they
have no marriage ceremony, and can put her away
at pleasure. They prize boy babies, but frequently kill
the girls, taking them out into the wilderness, stuffing
grass into their mouth and abandoning them; yet children
are highly esteemed, and the barren woman is a
reproach among her people. Such persons even go so
far as to make a doll or image of the offspring which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
so greatly desire, and fondle it as if it were a real
child.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Two husbands are also allowed to one woman;
one the chief or principal husband, and the other a
deputy, who acts as husband and master of the house
during the absence of the true lord; and who, upon the
latter's return, not only yields to him his place, but
becomes in the meantime his servant.</p>

<p>But the most repugnant of all their practices is that
of male concubinage. A Kadiak mother will select her
handsomest and most promising boy, and dress and rear
him as a girl, teaching him only domestic duties, keeping
him at woman's work, associating him only with women
and girls, in order to render his effeminacy complete.
Arriving at the age of ten or fifteen years, he is married
to some wealthy man, who regards such a companion as
a great acquisition. These male wives are called <i>achnutschik</i>
or <i>schopans</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">KONIAGAN SWEAT-HOUSES.</p>

<p>A most cruel superstition is enforced upon maidens
at the age of puberty; the victim being confined for six
months in a hut built for the purpose, apart from the
others, and so small that the poor inmate cannot straighten
her back while upon her knees. During the six
months following, she is allowed a room a little larger,
but is still permitted no intercourse with any one.
Daughters of principal men obtain the right of access to
the kashim by undergoing a ceremonial yielding up of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
their virginity to the shamán.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Marriage ceremonies
are few, and marriage engagements peculiar. The consent
of the father of the intended bride being obtained,
the aspirant for nuptial honors brings wood and builds a
fire in the bath-room; after which, he and the father take
a bath together. The relatives meanwhile congregate,
a feast is held, presents are made, the bridegroom takes
the name of the bride's father, the couple are escorted to
a heated vapor-bath and there left together. Although
extremely filthy in their persons and habits, all Indians
attach great importance to their sweat-baths. This peculiar
institution extends through most of the nations of our
territory, from Alaska to Mexico, with wonderful uniformity.
Frequently one of the side subterranean apartments
which open off from the main hall, is devoted to
the purposes of a sweat-house. Into one of these
caverns a Kadiak will enter stripped. Steam is generated
by throwing water upon heated stones. After
sweltering for a time in the confined and heated atmosphere,
and while yet in a profuse perspiration, the
bather rushes out and plunges into the nearest stream or
into the sea, frequently having to break the ice before
being able to finish his bath. Sometimes all the occupants
of the house join in a bath. They then clear the
floor of the main room from obstructions, and build a
hot fire under the smoke-hole. When the fire is reduced
to coals, a covering is placed over the smoke-hole, and
the bathers proceed to wash themselves in a certain liquid,
which is carefully saved for this and other cleansing purposes,
and also for tanning. The alkali of the fluid
combines with the grease upon their persons, and thus a
lather is formed which removes dirt as effectually as soap
would. They then wash in water, wrap themselves in
deer-skins, and repose upon shelves until the lassitude
occasioned by perspiration passes away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>Festivals of various kinds are held; as, when one village
is desirous of extending hospitality to another village,
or when an individual becomes ambitious of popularity,
a feast is given. A ceremonial banquet takes place a year
after the death of a relative; or an entertainment may
be announced as a reparation for an injury done to one's
neighbor. At some of these feasts only men dance, and
at others the women join. Upon these occasions, presents
are exchanged, and the festivities sometimes continue
for several days. The men appear upon the scene nearly
or quite naked, with painted faces, and the hair fantastically
decorated with feathers, dancing to the music of
the tambourine, sometimes accompanied by sham fights
and warlike songs. Their faces are marked or fantastically
painted, and they hold a knife or lance in one
hand and a rattle in the other. The women dance by
simply hopping forward and backward upon their toes.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
A visitor, upon entering a dwelling, is presented with a
cup of cold water; afterward, fish or flesh is set before
him, and it is expected that he will leave nothing uneaten.
The more he eats, the greater the honor to the
host; and, if it be impossible to eat all that is given him,
he must take away with him whatever remains. After
eating, he is conducted to a hot bath and regaled with a
drink of melted fat.</p>

<p>Sagoskin assisted at a ceremony which is celebrated
annually about the first of January at all the villages
on the coast. It is called the festival of the immersion
of the bladders in the sea. More than a hundred bladders,
taken only from animals which have been killed
with arrows, and decorated with fantastic paintings, are
hung upon a cord stretched horizontally along the wall
of the kashim. Four birds carved from wood, a screech-owl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
with the head of a man, a sea-gull, and two
partridges, are so disposed that they can be moved by
strings artfully arranged; the owl flutters his wings and
moves his head; the gull strikes the boards with his
beak as if he were catching fish, and the partridges commence
to peck each other. Lastly, a stake enveloped in
straw is placed in the centre of the fire-place. Men
and women dance before these effigies in honor of <i>Jug-jak</i>,
the spirit of the sea. Every time the dancing
ceases, one of the assistants lights some straw, burning
it like incense before the birds and the bladders. The
principal ceremony of the feast consists, as its name
indicates, in the immersion of the bladders in the sea.
It was impossible to discover the origin of this custom;
the only answer given to questions was, that their ancestors
had done so before them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SUPERSTITIONS OF THE KONIAGAS.</p>

<p>The shamán, or medicine-man of the Koniagas, is the
spiritual and temporal doctor of the tribe; wizard, sorcerer,
priest, or physician, as necessity demands. In the
execution of his offices, the shamán has several assistants,
male and female, sages and disciples; the first in rank
being called <i>kaseks</i>, whose duty it is to superintend
festivals and teach the children to dance. When a person
falls sick, some evil spirit is supposed to have taken possession
of him, and it is the business of the shamán to
exorcise that spirit, to combat and drive it out of the
man. To this end, armed with a magic tambourine, he
places himself near the patient and mutters his incantations.
A female assistant accompanies him with groans
and growls. Should this prove ineffectual, the shamán
approaches the bed and throws himself upon the person
of the sufferer; then, seizing the demon, he struggles
with it, overpowers and casts it out, while the assistants
cry, "He is gone! he is gone!" If the patient recovers,
the physician is paid, otherwise he receives nothing.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Colds, consumption, rheumatism, itch, boils, ulcers, syphilis,
are among their most common diseases. Blood-letting
is commonly resorted to as a curative, and except in
extreme cases the shamán is not called. The Koniagas
bleed one another by piercing the arm with a needle,
and then cutting away the flesh above the needle with a
flint or copper instrument. Beaver's oil is said to relieve
their rheumatism.</p>

<p>"The Kadiak people," says Lisiansky, "seem more
attached to their dead than to their living." In token
of their grief, surviving friends cut the hair, blacken the
face with soot, and the ancient custom was to remain in
mourning for a year. No work may be done for twenty
days, but after the fifth day the mourner may bathe.
Immediately after death, the body is arrayed in its best
apparel, or wrapped with moss in seal or sea-lion skins,
and placed in the kashim, or left in the house in which
the person died, where it remains for a time in state.
The body, with the arms and implements of the deceased,
is then buried. It was not unfrequent in former
times to sacrifice a slave upon such an occasion. The
grave is covered over with blocks of wood and large
stones.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> A mother, upon the death of a child, retires
for a time from the camp; a husband or wife withdraws
and joins another tribe.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The character of the Koniagas may be drawn as peaceable,
industrious, serviceable to Europeans, adapted to
labor and commerce rather than to war and hunting.
They are not more superstitious than civilized nations;
and their immorality, though to a stranger most rank,
is not to them of that socially criminal sort which loves
darkness and brings down the avenger. In their own
eyes, their abhorrent practices are as sinless as the ordinary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
openly conducted avocations of any community are

<p class="sidenote">THE ALEUTS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Aleuts</span> are the inhabitants of the Aleutian
Archipelago. The origin of the word is unknown;<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
the original name being <i>Kagataya Koung'ns</i>, or 'men
of the east,' indicating an American origin.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The nation
consists of two tribes speaking different dialects;
the <i>Unalaskans</i>, occupying the south-western portion of
the Alaskan Peninsula, the Shumagin Islands, and the
Fox Islands; and the <i>Atkhas</i>, inhabiting the Andreanovski,
Rat, and Near Islands. Migrations and intermixtures
with the Russians have, however, nearly obliterated
original distinctions.</p>

<p>The earliest information concerning the Aleutian Islanders
was obtained by Michael Nevodtsikoff, who
sailed from Kamchatka in 1745. Other Russian voyagers
immediately followed, attracted thither in search
of sea-animal skins, which at that time were very plentiful.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
Tribute was levied upon the islanders by the
Russians, and a system of cruelty commenced which
soon reduced the natives from ten thousand to but little
more than one thousand.</p>

<p>The Aleuts, to Langsdorff, "appear to be a sort of
middle race between the mongrel Tartars and the North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Americans." John Ledyard, who visited Unalaska with
Captain Cook, saw "two different kinds of people; the
one we knew to be the aborigines of America, while
we supposed the others to have come from the opposite
coasts of Asia."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Their features are strongly marked,
and those who saw them as they originally existed, were
impressed with the intelligent and benevolent expression
of their faces.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> They have an abundance of lank hair,
which they cut with flints&mdash;the men from the crown,
and the women in front.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Both sexes undergo the
usual face-painting and ornamentations. They extend
their nostrils by means of a bow-cylinder. The men
wear a bone about the size of a quill in the nose, and the
women insert pieces of bone in the under lip.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Their
legs are bowed, from spending so much of their time in
boats; they frequently sitting in them fifteen or twenty
hours at a time. Their figure is awkward and uncouth,
yet robust, active, capable of carrying heavy burdens and
undergoing great fatigue.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ALEUTIAN HAT AND HABITATION.</p>

<p>The hat of the Aleut is the most peculiar part of his
dress. It consists of a helmet-shaped crown of wood
or leather, with an exceedingly long brim in front, so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
to protect the eyes from the sun's reflection upon the
water and snow. Upon the apex is a small carving,
down the back part hang the beards of sea-lions, while
carved strips of bone and paint ornament the whole.
This hat also serves as a shield against arrows. The
Fox Islanders have caps of bird-skin, on which are left
the bright-colored feathers, wings, and tail.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> As a rule,
the men adopt bird-skin clothing, and the women furs,
the latter highly ornamented with beads and fringes.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The habitations of the Fox Islanders are called <i>Ullaa</i>,
and consist of immense holes from one to three hundred
feet in length, and from twenty to thirty feet wide.
They are covered with poles and earthed over, leaving
several openings at the top through which descent is
made by ladders. The interior is partitioned by stakes,
and three hundred people sometimes occupy one of these
places in common. They have no fire-place, since lamps
hollowed from flat stones answer every purpose for cooking
and light.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> A boat turned bottom upward is the
summer house of the Aleut.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>Raw seal and sea-otter, whale and sea-lion blubber,
fish, roots, and berries are staple articles of food among
the Aleuts. To procure vegetable food is too much
trouble. A dead, half-putrefied whale washed ashore is
always the occasion of great rejoicing. From all parts
the people congregate upon the shore, lay in their winter
supplies, and stuff themselves until not a morsel remains.
November is their best hunting-season. Whale-fishing
is confined to certain families, and the spirit of
the craft descends from father to son. Birds are caught
in a net attached to the end of a pole; sea-otter are shot
with arrows; spears, bone hooks, and nets are used in
fishing.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> After the advent of the Russians, the natives
were not allowed to kill fur-animals without accounting
to them therefor.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Their weapons are darts with single and double barbs,
which they throw from boards; barbed, bone-pointed
lances; spears, harpoons, and arrows, with bone or stone
points. At their side is carried a sharp stone knife ten
or twelve inches long, and for armor they wear a coat
of plaited rushes, which covers the whole body.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Aleut bear-trap consists of a board two feet square and
two inches thick, planted with barbed spikes, placed in
bruin's path and covered with dust. The unsuspecting
victim steps firmly upon the smooth surface offered,
when his foot sinks into the dust. Maddened with
pain, he puts forward another foot to assist in pulling
the first away, when that too is caught. Soon all four
of the feet are firmly spiked to the board; the beast rolls
over on his back, and his career is soon brought to an
end.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS OF THE ALEUTS.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their peaceful character, the occupants
of the several islands were almost constantly at
war. Blood, the only atonement for offense, must be
washed out by blood, and the line of vengeance becomes
endless. At the time of discovery, the Unimak
Islanders held the supremacy.</p>

<p>The fabrications of the Aleuts comprise household
utensils of stone, bone, and wood; missiles of war and
the chase; mats and baskets of grass and the roots of
trees, neat and strong; bird-beak rattles, tambourines
or drums, wooden hats and carved figures. From
the wing-bone of the sea-gull, the women make their
needles; from sinews, they make thread and cord.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> To
obtain glue for mending or manufacturing purposes, they
strike the nose until it bleeds.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> To kindle a fire, they
make use of sulphur, in which their volcanic islands
abound, and the process is very curious. First they
prepare some dry grass to catch the fire; then they take
two pieces of quartz, and, holding them over the grass,
rub them well with native sulphur. A few feathers are
scattered over the grass to catch the particles of sulphur,
and, when all is ready, holding the stones over the grass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
they strike them together; a flash is produced by the concussion,
the sulphur ignites, and the straw blazes up.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The Aleuts have no marriage ceremony. Every man
takes as many women to wife as he can support, or
rather as he can get to support him. Presents are made
to the relatives of the bride, and when she ceases to
possess attractions or value in the eyes of her proprietor,
she is sent back to her friends. Wives are exchanged
by the men, and rich women are permitted to indulge
in two husbands. Male concubinage obtains throughout
the Aleutian Islands, but not to the same extent as
among the Koniagas.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Mothers plunge their crying babies
under water in order to quiet them. This remedy
performed in winter amid broken ice, is very effectual.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Every island, and, in the larger islands, every village,
has its <i>toyon</i>, or chief, who decides differences, is exempt
from work, is allowed a servant to row his boat,
but in other respects possesses no power. The office is
elective.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The Aleuts are fond of dancing and given to hospitality.
The stranger guest, as he approaches the village, is met by
dancing men and dancing women, who conduct him to
the house of the host, where food is given him. After
supper, the dancing, now performed by naked men, continues
until all are exhausted, when the hospitalities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the dwelling are placed at the disposal of the guest, and
all retire.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> A religious festival used to be held in December,
at which all the women of the village assembled
by moonlight, and danced naked with masked faces, the
men being excluded under penalty of death. The men
and women of a village bathe together, in aboriginal
innocency, unconscious of impropriety. They are fond
of pantomimic performances; of representing in dances
their myths and their legends; of acting out a chase, one
assuming the part of hunter, another of a bird or beast
trying to escape the snare, now succeeding, now failing&mdash;the
piece ending in the transformation of a captive bird
into a lovely woman, who falls exhausted into the arms
of the hunter.</p>

<p>The dead are clothed and masked, and either placed
in the cleft of a rock, or swung in a boat or cradle from
a pole in the open air. They seem to guard the body
as much as possible from contact with the ground.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE ALEUTS.</p>

<p>In their nature and disposition, these islanders are
sluggish but strong. Their sluggishness gives to their
character a gentleness and obsequiousness often remarked
by travelers; while their inherent strength, when roused
by brutal passions, drives them on to the greatest enormities.
They are capable of enduring great fatigue, and,
when roused to action by necessity, they will perform
an incredible amount of work, suffering the severest
cold or heat or hunger with the most stoical calmness.
They are very quiet in their demeanor; sometimes sitting
in companies within their dens, or on their house-tops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
gazing at the sea for hours, without speaking a word.
It is said that formerly they were much more gay and
cheerful, but that an acquaintance with civilization has
been productive of the usual misfortune and misery.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear that the Russians were behind the
Spaniards in their barbarous treatment of the natives.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Notwithstanding their interest lay in preserving life, and
holding the natives in a state of serfdom as fishers and
hunters, the poor people were soon swept away. Father
Innocentius Veniaminoff, a Russian missionary who labored
among the islanders long and faithfully, gives them
the highest character for probity and propriety. Among
other things, he affirms that during a residence of ten
years in Unalaska, there did not occur a single fight
among the natives. Proselytes were made by the Russians
with the same facility as by the Spaniards. Tribute
was levied by the Russians upon all the islanders,
but, for three years after their conversion, neophytes were
exempt; a cheap release from hateful servitude, thought
the poor Aleut; and a polity which brought into the folds
of the church pagan multitudes.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE THLINKEETS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Thlinkeets</span>, as they call themselves, or <i>Kolosches</i>,
as they are designated by the Russians, inhabit the coast
and islands from Mount St Elias to the river Nass.
The name Thlinkeet signifies 'man,' or 'human being.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Kolosch,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> or more properly <i>Kaluga</i>, is the Aleutian
word for 'dish,' and was given to this people by Aleutian
seal-hunters whom the Russians employed during
their first occupation of the Island of the Sitkas. Perceiving
a resemblance in the shape of the Thlinkeet lip-ornament,
to the wooden vessels of their own country,
they applied to this nation the name Kaluga, whence
the Kolosches of the Russians.</p>

<p>Holmberg carries their boundaries down to the Columbia
River; and Wrangell perceives a likeness, real
or imaginary, to the Aztecs.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Indeed the differences
between the Thlinkeets and the inhabitants of New Caledonia,
Washington, and Oregon, are so slight that the
whole might without impropriety be called one people.
The Thlinkeets have, however, some peculiarities not
found elsewhere; they are a nation distinct from the
Tinneh upon their eastern border, and I therefore treat
of them separately.</p>

<p>The three families of nations already considered,
namely, the Eskimos, the Koniagas, and the Aleuts, are
all designated by most writers as Eskimos. Some even
include the Thlinkeets, notwithstanding their physical
and philological differences, which, as well as their traditions,
are as broadly marked as those of nations that
these same ethnologists separate into distinct families.
Nomadic nations, occupying lands by a precarious tenure,
with ever-changing boundaries, engaged in perpetual hostilities
with conterminous tribes that frequently annihilate
or absorb an entire community, so graduate into one
another that the dividing line is often with difficulty determined.
Thus the Thlinkeets, now almost universally
held to be North American Indians proper, and distinct
from the Eskimos, possess, perhaps, as many affinities to
their neighbors on the north, as to those upon the south
and east. The conclusion is obvious. The native races of
America, by their geographical position and the climatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
influences which govern them, are of necessity to a certain
degree similar; while a separation into isolated
communities which are acted upon by local causes, results
in national or tribal distinctions. Thus the human
race in America, like the human race throughout the
world, is uniform in its variety, and varied in its unity.</p>

<p>The Thlinkeet family, commencing at the north, comprises
the <i>Ugalenzes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> on the shore of the continent
between Mount St Elias and Copper River; the <i>Yakutats</i>,
of Bering Bay; the <i>Chilkats</i>, at Lynn Canal; the
<i>Hoodnids</i>, at Cross Sound; the <i>Hoodsinoos</i>, of Chatham
Strait; and, following down the coast and islands, the
<i>Takoos</i>, the <i>Auks</i>, the <i>Kakas</i>, the <i>Sitkas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the <i>Stikines</i>,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
and the <i>Tungass</i>. The Sitkas on Baranoff Island<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> are
the dominant tribe.</p>

<p>Descending from the north into more genial climes, the
physical type changes, and the form assumes more graceful
proportions. With the expansion of nature and a
freer play of physical powers, the mind expands, native
character becomes intensified, instinct keener, savage
nature more savage, the nobler qualities become more
noble; cruelty is more cruel, torture is elevated into an
art, stoicism is cultivated,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> human sacrifice and human
slavery begin, and the oppression and degradation of
woman is systematized. "If an original American race
is accepted," says Holmberg, "the Thlinkeets must be
classed with them." They claim to have migrated from
the interior of the continent, opposite Queen Charlotte
Island.</p>

<p>The Ugalenzes spend their winters at a small bay east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
from Kadiak, and their summers near the mouth of
Copper River, where they take fish in great quantities.
Their country also abounds in beaver. The Chilkats
make two annual trading excursions into the interior.
The Tacully tribes, the Sicannis and Nehannes, with
whom the Chilkats exchange European goods for furs,
will allow no white man to ascend their streams.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THLINKEET PECULIARITIES.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Thlinkeets are a fine race; the men better
formed than the boatmen of the north;<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> the women
modest, fair, and handsome;<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> but the latter have gone
far out of their way to spoil the handiwork of nature.
Not content with daubing the head and body with filthy
coloring mixtures; with adorning the neck with copper-wire
collars, and the face with grotesque wooden masks;
with scarring their limbs and breast with keen-edged
instruments; with piercing the nose and ears, and filling
the apertures with bones, shells, sticks, pieces of copper,
nails, or attaching to them heavy pendants, which drag
down the organs and pull the features out of place;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
they appear to have taxed their inventive powers to the
utmost, and with a success unsurpassed by any nation
in the world, to produce a model of hideous beauty.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THLINKEET LIP-ORNAMENT.</p>

<p>This success is achieved in their wooden lip-ornament,
the crowning glory of the Thlinkeet matron, described
by a multitude of eye-witnesses; and the ceremony of
its introduction may be not inappropriately termed, the
baptism of the block. At the age of puberty,&mdash;some say
during infancy or childhood,&mdash;in the under lip of all free-born
female Thlinkeets,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> a slit is made parallel with the
mouth, and about half an inch below it.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> If the incision
is made during infancy, it is only a small hole, into which
a needle of copper, a bone, or a stick is inserted, the
size being increased as the child grows. If the baptism
is deferred until the period when the maiden merges
into womanhood, the operation is necessarily upon a
larger scale, and consequently more painful.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the incision is made, a copper wire, or a piece of shell
or wood, is introduced, which keeps the wound open and
the aperture extended; and by enlarging the object and
keeping up a continuous but painful strain, an artificial
opening in the face is made of the required dimensions.
On attaining the age of maturity, this wire or other
incumbrance is removed and a block of wood inserted.
This block is oval or elliptical in shape, concaved or
hollowed dish-like on the sides, and grooved like the
wheel of a pulley on the edge in order to keep it in
place.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The dimensions of the block are from two to six
inches in length, from one to four inches in width, and
about half an inch thick round the edge, and highly polished.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
Old age has little terror in the eyes of a Thlinkeet
belle, for larger lip-blocks are introduced as years
advance, and each enlargement adds to the lady's social
status, if not to her facial charms. When the block is
withdrawn, the lip drops down upon the chin like a piece
of leather, displaying the teeth, and presenting altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
a ghastly spectacle.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> This custom is evidently associated
in their minds with womanly modesty, for when La
Pérouse asked them to remove their block, some refused;
those who complied manifesting the same embarrassment
shown by a European woman who uncovers her bosom.
The Yakutats alone of all the Thlinkeet nation have
never adopted this fashion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS OF THE THLINKEETS.</p>

<p>Their dress, which is made from wolf, deer, bear, or
other skin, extends from the shoulder to the knee, and
consists of a mantle, or cape, with sleeves, which reaches
down to the waist, and to which the women attach a
skirt, or gown, and the men a belt and apron. A white
blanket is made from the wool of the wild sheep, embroidered
with figures, and fringed with furs, all of native
work. This garment is most highly prized by the men.
They wear it thrown over the shoulder so as to cover the
whole body.</p>

<p>Vancouver thus describes the dress of a chief at Lynn
Canal. His "external robe was a very fine large garment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
that reached from his neck down to his heels,
made of wool from the mountain sheep, neatly variegated
with several colors, and edged and otherwise decorated
with little tufts or frogs of woolen yarn, dyed of
various colors. His head-dress was made of wood, much
resembling in its shape a crown, adorned with bright
copper and brass plates, from whence hung a number of
tails or streamers, composed of wool and fur, wrought
together, dyed of various colors, and each terminating
in a whole ermine skin. The whole exhibited a magnificent
appearance, and indicated a taste for dress and
ornament that we had not supposed the natives of these
regions to possess."</p>

<p>The men make a wooden mask, which rests on a neckpiece,
very ingeniously carved, and painted in colors, so
as to represent the head of some bird or beast or mythological
being. This was formerly worn in battle, probably,
as La Pérouse suggests, in order to strike terror into
the hearts of enemies, but is now used only on festive
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>A small hat of roots and bark, woven in the shape of
a truncated cone, ornamented with painted figures and
pictures of animals, is worn by both sexes.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Ordinarily,
however, the men wear nothing on the head; their thick
hair, greased and covered with ochre and birds' down,
forming a sufficient covering. The hat is designed especially
for rainy weather, as a protection to the elaborately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
dressed hair.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Besides their every-day dress, they have
a fantastic costume for tribal holidays.</p>

<p>For their winter habitations, a little back from the
ocean, the Thlinkeets build substantial houses of plank
or logs, sometimes of sufficient strength to serve as a
fortress. They are six or eight feet in height, the base
in the form of a square or parallelogram, the roof of
poles placed at an angle of forty-five degrees and covered
with bark. The entrance is by a small side door.
The fire, which is usually kept burning night and day,
occupies the centre of the room; over it is a smoke-hole
of unusual size, and round the sides of the room
are apartments or dens which are used as store-houses,
sweat-houses, and private family rooms. The main room
is very public and very filthy.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Summer huts are light
portable buildings, thrown up during hunting excursions
in the interior, or on the sea-beach in the fishing-season.
A frame is made of stakes driven into the ground, supporting
a roof, and the whole covered with bark, or with
green or dry branches, and skins or bark over all. The
door is closed by bark or a curtain of skins. Each hut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
is the rendezvous for a small colony, frequently covering
twenty or thirty persons, all under the direction of
one chief.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE THLINKEETS.</p>

<p>The food of the Thlinkeets is derived principally from
the ocean, and consists of fish, mussels, sea-weeds, and
in fact whatever is left upon the beach by the ebbing
tide&mdash;which at Sitka rises and falls eighteen feet twice
a day&mdash;or can be caught by artificial means. Holmberg
says that all but the Yakutats hate whale as the Jews
hate pork. Roots, grasses, berries, and snails are among
their summer luxuries. They chew a certain plant as
some chew tobacco, mixing with it lime to give it a
stronger effect,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and drink whale-oil as a European
drinks beer. Preferring their food cooked, they put it
in a tight wicker basket, pouring in water, and throwing
in heated stones, until the food is boiled.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
winter, they dry large quantities of herring, roes, and
the flesh of animals.</p>

<p>For catching fish, they stake the rivers, and also use
a hook and line; one fisherman casting from his canoe
ten or fifteen lines, with bladders for floats. For herring,
they fasten to the end of a pole four or five pointed bones,
and with this instrument strike into a shoal, spearing a
fish on every point. They sometimes make the same instrument
in the shape of a rake, and transfix the fish with
the teeth. The Sitkas catch halibut with large, wooden,
bone-pointed hooks.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The arms of the Thlinkeets denote a more warlike
people than any we have hitherto encountered. Bows
and arrows; hatchets of flint, and of a hard green stone
which cuts wood so smoothly that no marks of notches
are left; great lances, six or eight varas in length, if
Bodega y Quadra may be trusted, hardened in the fire or
pointed with copper, or later with iron; a large, broad,
double-ended dagger, or knife,&mdash;are their principal weapons.
The knife is their chief implement and constant
companion. The handle is nearer one end than the
other, so that it has a long blade and a short blade, the
latter being one quarter the length of the former. The
handle is covered with leather, and a strap fastens it
to the hand when fighting. Both blades have leathern
sheaths, one of which is suspended from the neck by a
strap.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE THLINKEETS IN WAR.</p>

<p>They also encase almost the entire body in a wooden
and leathern armor. Their helmets have curiously
carved vizors, with grotesque representations of beings
natural or supernatural, which, when brilliantly or dismally
painted, and presented with proper yells, and
brandishings of their ever-glittering knives, are supposed
to strike terror into the heart of their enemies. They
make a breast-plate of wood, and an arrow-proof coat of
thin flexible strips, bound with strings like a woman's
stays.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>When a Thlinkeet arms for war, he paints his face
and powders his hair a brilliant red. He then ornaments
his head with white eagle-feathers, a token of
stern, vindictive determination. During war they pitch
their camp in strong positions, and place the women on
guard. Trial by combat is frequently resorted to, not
only to determine private disputes, but to settle quarrels
between petty tribes. In the latter case, each side
chooses a champion, the warriors place themselves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
battle array, the combatants armed with their favorite
weapon, the dagger, and well armored, step forth and
engage in fight; while the people on either side engage
in song and dance during the combat. Wrangell and
Laplace assert that brave warriors killed in battle are
devoured by the conquerors, in the belief that the bravery
of the victim thereby enters into the nature of the
partaker.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Coming from the north, the Thlinkeets are the first
people of the coast who use wooden boats. They are
made from a single trunk; the smaller ones about fifteen
feet long, to carry from ten to twelve persons; and the
larger ones, or war canoes, from fifty to seventy feet
long; these will carry forty or fifty persons. They have
from two and a half to three feet beam; are sharp fore
and aft, and have the bow and stern raised, the former
rather more than the latter. Being very light and well
modeled, they can be handled with ease and celerity.
Their paddles are about four feet in length, with crutch-like
handles and wide, shovel-shaped blades. Boats as
well as paddles are ornamented with painted figures,
and the family coat-of-arms. Bodega y Quadra, in contradiction
to all other authorities, describes these canoes
as being built in three parts; with one hollowed piece,
which forms the bottom and reaches well up the sides,
and with two side planks. Having hollowed the trunk
of a tree to the required depth, the Thlinkeet builders
fill it with water, which they heat with hot stones to
soften the wood, and in this state bend it to the desired
shape. When they land, they draw their boats up on
the beach, out of reach of the tide, and take great care
in preserving them.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">INDUSTRIES OF THE THLINKEETS.</p>

<p>The Thlinkeets manifest no less ingenuity in the manufacture
of domestic and other implements than in their
arms. Rope they make from sea-weed, water-tight baskets
and mats from withes and grass; and pipes, bowls,
and figures from a dark clay. They excel in the working
of stone and copper, making necklaces, bracelets, and
rings; they can also forge iron. They spin thread, use the
needle, and make blankets from the white native wool.
They exhibit considerable skill in carving and painting,
ornamenting the fronts of their houses with heraldic
symbols, and allegorical and historical figures; while in
front of the principal dwellings, and on their canoes, are
carved parts representing the human face, the heads of
crows, eagles, sea-lions, and bears.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> La Pérouse asserts
that, except in agriculture, which was not entirely unknown
to them, the Thlinkeets were farther advanced in
industry than the South Sea Islanders.</p>

<p>Trade is carried on between Europeans and the interior
Indians, in which no little skill is manifested.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Every article which they purchase undergoes the closest
scrutiny, and every slight defect, which they are sure to
discover, sends down the price. In their commercial
intercourse they exhibit the utmost decorum, and conduct
their negotiations with the most becoming dignity.
Nevertheless, for iron and beads they willingly part with
anything in their possession, even their children. In
the voyage of Bodega y Quadra, several young Thlinkeets
thus became the property of the Spaniards, as the
author piously remarks, for purposes of conversion. Sea-otter
skins circulate in place of money.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The office of chief is elective, and the extent of power
wielded depends upon the ability of the ruler. In some
this authority is nominal; others become great despots.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Slavery was practiced to a considerable extent; and not
only all prisoners of war were slaves, but a regular slave-trade
was carried on with the south. When first known
to the Russians, according to Holmberg, most of their
slaves were Flatheads from Oregon. Slaves are not
allowed to hold property or to marry, and when old and
worthless they are killed. Kotzebue says that a rich
man "purchases male and female slaves, who must
labor and fish for him, and strengthen his force when he
is engaged in warfare. The slaves are prisoners of war,
and their descendants; the master's power over them is
unlimited, and he even puts them to death without
scruple. When the master dies, two slaves are murdered
on his grave that he may not want attendance in
the other world; these are chosen long before the event
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
occurs, but meet the destiny that awaits them very philosophically."
Simpson estimates the slaves to be one third
of the entire population. Interior tribes enslave their
prisoners of war, but, unlike the coast tribes, they have
no hereditary slavery, nor systematic traffic in slaves.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CASTE AND CLANSHIP.</p>

<p>With the superior activity and intelligence of the Thlinkeets,
social castes begin to appear. Besides an hereditary
nobility, from which class all chiefs are chosen, the
whole nation is separated into two great divisions or
clans, one of which is called the Wolf, and the other the
Raven. Upon their houses, boats, robes, shields, and
wherever else they can find a place for it, they paint or
carve their crest, an heraldic device of the beast or the
bird designating the clan to which the owner belongs. The
Raven trunk is again divided into sub-clans, called the
Frog, the Goose, the Sea-Lion, the Owl, and the Salmon.
The Wolf family comprises the Bear, Eagle, Dolphin,
Shark, and Alca. In this clanship some singular social
features present themselves. People are at once thrust
widely apart, and yet drawn together. Tribes of the same
clan may not war on each other, but at the same time
members of the same clan may not marry with each other.
Thus the young Wolf warrior must seek his mate among
the Ravens, and, while celebrating his nuptials one day,
he may be called upon the next to fight his father-in-law
over some hereditary feud. Obviously this singular
social fancy tends greatly to keep the various tribes of
the nation at peace.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Although the Thlinkeet women impose upon themselves
the most painful and rigorous social laws, there
are few savage nations in which the sex have greater
influence or command greater respect. Whether it be
the superiority of their intellects, their success in rendering
their hideous charms available, or the cruel penances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
imposed upon womanhood, the truth is that not
only old men, but old women, are respected. In fact, a
remarkably old and ugly crone is accounted almost above
nature&mdash;a sorceress. One cause of this is that they are
much more modest and chaste than their northern sisters.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
As a rule, a man has but one wife; more, however,
being allowable. A chief of the Nass tribe is said
to have had forty.</p>

<p>A young girl arrived at the age of maturity is deemed
unclean; and everything she comes in contact with, or
looks upon, even the clear sky or pure water, is thereby
rendered unpropitious to man. She is therefore thrust
from the society of her fellows, and confined in a dark
den as a being unfit for the sun to shine upon. There
she is kept sometimes for a whole year. Langsdorff
suggests that it may be during this period of confinement
that the foundation of her influence is laid; that
in modest reserve, and meditation, her character is
strengthened, and she comes forth cleansed in mind as
well as body. This infamous ordeal, coming at a most
critical period, and in connection with the baptism of the
block, cannot fail to exert a powerful influence upon her
character.</p>

<p>It is a singular idea that they have of uncleanness.
During all this time, according to Holmberg, only the
girl's mother approaches her, and that only to place food
within her reach. There she lies, wallowing in her
filth, scarcely able to move. It is almost incredible that
human beings can bring themselves so to distort nature.
To this singular custom, as well as to that of the block,
female slaves do not conform. After the girl's immurement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
is over, if her parents are wealthy, her old clothing
is destroyed, she is washed and dressed anew, and a grand
feast given in honor of the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The natural sufferings
of mothers during confinement are also aggravated
by custom. At this time they too are considered
unclean, and must withdraw into the forest or fields, away
from all others, and take care of themselves and their offspring.
After the birth of a child, the mother is locked
up in a shed for ten days.</p>

<p>A marriage ceremony consists in the assembling of
friends and distribution of presents. A newly married
pair must fast for two days thereafter, in order to insure
domestic felicity. After the expiration of that time they
are permitted to partake of a little food, when a second
two days' fast is added, after which they are allowed to
come together for the first time; but the mysteries of
wedlock are not fully unfolded to them until four weeks
after marriage.</p>

<p>Very little is said by travelers regarding the bath-houses
of the Thlinkeets, but I do not infer that they
used them less than their neighbors. In fact, notwithstanding
their filth, purgations and purifications are
commenced at an early age. As soon as an infant is
born, and before it has tasted food, whatever is in the
stomach must be squeezed out. Mothers nurse their
children from one to two and a half years. When the
child is able to leave its cradle, it is bathed in the ocean
every day without regard to season, and this custom is
kept up by both sexes through life. Those that survive
the first year of filth, and the succeeding years of applied
ice water and exposure, are very justly held to be well
toughened.</p>

<p>The Thlinkeet child is frequently given two names, one
from the father's side and one from the mother's; and
when a son becomes more famous than his father, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
latter drops his own name, and is known only as the
father of his son. Their habits of life are regular. In
summer, at early dawn they put out to sea in their boats,
or seek for food upon the beach, returning before noon
for their first meal. A second one is taken just before
night. The work is not unequally divided between the
sexes, and the division is based upon the economical
principles of civilized communities. The men rarely
conclude a bargain without consulting their wives.</p>

<p>Marchand draws a revolting picture of their treatment
of infants. The little bodies are so excoriated by fermented
filth, and so scarred by their cradle, that they
carry the marks to the grave. No wonder that when
they grow up they are insensible to pain. Nor are the
mothers especially given to personal cleanliness and decorum.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Music, as well as the arts, is cultivated by the Thlinkeets,
and, if we may believe Marchand, ranks with
them as a social institution. "At fixed times," he says,
"evening and morning, they sing in chorus, every one
takes part in the concert, and from the pensive air which
they assume while singing, one would imagine that the
song has some deep interest for them." The men do the
dancing, while the women, who are rather given to fatness
and flaccidity, accompany them with song and tambourine.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Their principal gambling game is played with thirty
small sticks, of various colors, and called by divers
names, as the crab, the whale, and the duck. The
player shuffles together all the sticks, then counting out
seven, he hides them under a bunch of moss, keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the remainder covered at the same time. The game is
to guess in which pile is the whale, and the crab, and
the duck. During the progress of the game, they present
a perfect picture of melancholic stoicism.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The Thlinkeets burn their dead. An exception is
made when the deceased is a shamán or a slave; the
body of the former is preserved, after having been
wrapped in furs, in a large wooden sarcophagus; and the
latter is thrown out into the ocean or anywhere, like a
beast. The ashes of the burned Thlinkeet are carefully
collected in a box covered with hieroglyphic figures, and
placed upon four posts. The head of a warrior killed in
battle is cut off before the body is burned, and placed
in a box supported by two poles over the box that holds
his ashes.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Some tribes preserve the bodies of those
who die during the winter, until forced to get rid of
them by the warmer weather of spring. Their grandest
feasts are for the dead. Besides the funeral ceremony,
which is the occasion of a festival, they hold an annual
'elevation of the dead,' at which times they erect monuments
to the memory of their departed.</p>

<p>The shamáns possess some knowledge of the medicinal
properties of herbs, but the healing of the body does
not constitute so important a part of their vocation as
do their dealings with supernatural powers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THLINKEET CHARACTER.</p>

<p>To sum up the character of the Thlinkeets, they may
be called bold, brave, shrewd, intelligent, industrious, lovers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of art and music, respectful to women and the aged;
yet extremely cruel, scalping and maiming their prisoners
out of pure wantonness, thievish, lying, and inveterate
gamblers. In short they possess most of the virtues and
vices incident to savagism.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE TINNEH.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Tinneh</span>, the fifth and last division of our Hyperborean
group, occupy the 'Great Lone Land,' between
Hudson Bay and the conterminous nations already described;
a land greater than the whole of the United
States, and more 'lone,' excepting absolute deserts, than
any part of America. White men there are scarcely
any; wild men and wild beasts there are few; few
dense forests, and little vegetation, although the grassy
savannahs sustain droves of deer, buffalo, and other
animals. The Tinneh are, next to the Eskimos, the most
northern people of the continent. They inhabit the unexplored
regions of Central Alaska, and thence extend
eastward, their area widening towards the south to the
shores of Hudson Bay. Within their domain, from the
north-west to the south-east, may be drawn a straight
line measuring over four thousand miles in length.</p>

<p>The Tinneh,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> may be divided into four great families
of nations; namely, the <i>Chepewyans</i>, or Athabascas, living
between Hudson Bay and the Rocky Mountains; the <i>Tacullies</i>,
or Carriers, of New Caledonia or North-western
British America; the <i>Kutchins</i>, occupying both banks of
the upper Yukon and its tributaries, from near its mouth
to the Mackenzie River; and the <i>Kenai</i>, inhabiting the
interior from the lower Yukon to Copper River.</p>

<p>The Chepewyan family is composed of the Northern
Indians, so called by the fur-hunters at Fort Churchill
as lying along the shores of Hudson Bay, directly to their
north; the Copper Indians, on Coppermine River; the
Horn Mountain and Beaver Indians, farther to the west;
the Strong-bows, Dog-ribs, Hares, Red-knives, Sheep,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Sarsis, Brush-wood, Nagailer, and Rocky-Mountain Indians,
of the Mackenzie River and Rocky Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The Tacully<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> nation is divided into a multitude of
petty tribes, to which different travelers give different
names according to fancy. Among them the most important
are the Talkotins and Chilkotins, Nateotetains
and Sicannis, of the upper branches of Fraser River and
vicinity. It is sufficient for our purpose, however, to
treat them as one nation.</p>

<p>The Kutchins,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> a large and powerful nation, are composed
of the following tribes. Commencing at the Mackenzie
River, near its mouth, and extending westward
across the mountains to and down the Yukon; the Loucheux
or Quarrellers, of the Mackenzie River; the Vanta
Kutchin, Natche Kutchin, and Yukuth Kutchin, of Porcupine
River and neighborhood; the Tutchone Kutchin,
Han Kutchin, Kutcha Kutchin, Gens de Bouleau, Gens
de Milieu, Tenan Kutchin, Nuclukayettes, and Newicarguts,
of the Yukon River. Their strip of territory is
from one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles in
width, lying immediately south of the Eskimos, and
extending westward from the Mackenzie River about
eight hundred miles.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>The Kenai<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> nation includes the Ingaliks, of the Lower
Yukon; the Koltchanes, of the Kuskoquim River; and
to the south-eastward, the Kenais, of the Kenai Peninsula,
and the Atnas, of Copper River.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that the Tinneh are essentially an inland
people, barred out from the frozen ocean by a thin strip
of Eskimo land, and barely touching the Pacific at Cook
Inlet. Philologists, however, find dialectic resemblances,
imaginary or real, between them and the Umpquas<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and
Apaches.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CHEPEWYANS.</p>

<p>The name Chepewyan signifies 'pointed coat,' and derives
its origin from the parka, coat, or outer garment, so
universally common throughout this region. It is made
of several skins differently dressed and ornamented in
different localities, but always cut with the skirt pointed
before and behind. The Chepewyans believe that their
ancestors migrated from the east, and therefore those of
them who are born nearest their eastern boundary, are
held in the greatest estimation. The Dog-ribs alone refer
their origin to the west.</p>

<p>The Chepewyans are physically characterized by a long
full face,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> tall slim figure;<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> in complexion they are darker
than coast tribes,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and have small piercing black eyes,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
flowing hair,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and tattooed cheeks and forehead.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Altogether
they are pronounced an inferior race.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Into
the composition of their garments enter beaver, moose,
and deer-skin, dressed with and without the hair, sewed
with sinews and ornamented with claws, horns, teeth, and
feathers.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE NORTHERN INDIANS.</p>

<p>The Northern Indian man is master of his household.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
He marries without ceremony, and divorces his wife at
his pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> A man of forty buys or fights for a spouse
of twelve,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and when tired of her whips her and sends
her away. Girls on arriving at the age of womanhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
must retire from the village and live for a time apart.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
The Chepewyans inhabit huts of brush and portable skin
tents. They derive their origin from a dog. At one time
they were so strongly imbued with respect for their canine
ancestry that they entirely ceased to employ dogs
in drawing their sledges, greatly to the hardship of the
women upon whom this laborious task fell.</p>

<p>Their food consists mostly of fish and reindeer, the
latter being easily taken in snares. Much of their land
is barren, but with sufficient vegetation to support numerous
herds of reindeer, and fish abound in their lakes
and streams. Their hunting grounds are held by clans,
and descend by inheritance from one generation to another,
which has a salutary effect upon the preservation
of game. Indian law requires the successful hunter to
share the spoils of the chase with all present. When
game is abundant, their tent-fires never die, but are surrounded
during all hours of the day and night by young
and old cooking their food.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Superabundance of food, merchandise, or anything
which they wish to preserve without the trouble of carrying
it about with them while on hunting or foraging
expeditions, is <i>cached</i>, as they term it; from the French,
<i>cacher</i>, to conceal. Canadian fur-hunters often resorted
to this artifice, but the practice was common among the
natives before the advent of Europeans. A sudden necessity
often arises in Indian countries for the traveler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
to relieve himself from burdens. This is done by digging
a hole in the earth and depositing the load therein,
so artfully covering it as to escape detection by the wily
savages. Goods may be cached in a cave, or in the
branches of a tree, or in the hollow of a log. The camp-fire
is frequently built over the spot where stores have
been deposited, in order that the disturbance of the surface
may not be detected.</p>

<p>Their weapons<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and their utensils<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> are of the most
primitive kind&mdash;stone and bone being used in place of
metal.</p>

<p>Their dances, which are always performed in the
night, are not original, but are borrowed from the Southern
and Dog-rib Indians. They consist in raising the
feet alternately in quick succession, as high as possible
without moving the body, to the sound of a drum or
rattle.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>They never bury their dead, but leave the bodies
where they fall, to be devoured by the birds and beasts
of prey.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Their religion consists chiefly in songs and
speeches to these birds and beasts and to imaginary beings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
for assistance in performing cures of the sick.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Old age is treated with disrespect and neglect, one half
of both sexes dying before their time for want of care.
The Northern Indians are frequently at war with the
Eskimos and Southern Indians, for whom they at all
times entertain the most inveterate hatred. The Copper
Indians, bordering on the southern boundary of the Eskimos
at the Coppermine River, were originally the
occupants of the territory south of Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>The Dog-ribs, or Slavés as they are called by neighboring
nations, are indolent, fond of amusement, but mild
and hospitable. They are so debased, as savages, that
the men do the laborious work, while the women employ
themselves in household affairs and ornamental needlework.
Young married men have been known to exhibit
specimens of their wives' needle-work with pride. From
their further advancement in civilization, and the tradition
which they hold of having migrated from the
westward, were it not that their language differs from
that of contiguous tribes only in accent, they might naturally
be considered of different origin. Bands of Dog-ribs
meeting after a long absence greet each other with a
dance, which frequently continues for two or three days.
First clearing a spot of ground, they take an arrow in
the right hand and a bow in the left, and turning their
backs each band to the other, they approach dancing, and
when close together they feign to perceive each other's
presence for the first time; the bow and arrow are instantly
transferred from one hand to the other, in token
of their non-intention to use them against friends. They
are very improvident, and frequently are driven to cannibalism
and suicide.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">HARES, DOG-RIBS, AND TACULLIES.</p>

<p>The Hare Indians, who speak a dialect of the Tinneh
scarcely to be distinguished from that of the Dog-ribs,
are looked upon by their neighbors as great conjurers.
The Hare and Sheep Indians look upon their women
as inferior beings. From childhood they are inured to
every description of drudgery, and though not treated
with special cruelty, they are placed at the lowest point
in the scale of humanity. The characteristic stoicism
of the red race is not manifested by these tribes. Socialism
is practiced to a considerable extent. The hunter is
allowed only the tongue and ribs of the animal he kills,
the remainder being divided among the members of the
tribe.</p>

<p>The Hares and Dog-ribs do not cut the finger-nails of
female children until four years of age, in order that
they may not prove lazy; the infant is not allowed food
until four days after birth, in order to accustom it to
fasting in the next world.</p>

<p>The Sheep Indians are reported as being cannibals.
The Red-knives formerly hunted reindeer and musk-oxen
at the northern end of Great Bear Lake, but they
were finally driven eastward by the Dog-ribs. Laws
and government are unknown to the Chepewyans.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE TACULLIES, OR CARRIERS.</p>

<p>The Tacullies, or, as they were denominated by the
fur-traders, 'Carriers,' are the chief tribe of New Caledonia,
or North-western British America. They call
themselves Tacullies, or 'men who go upon water,' as
their travels from one village to another are mostly accomplished
in canoes. This, with their sobriquet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
'Carriers,' clearly indicates their ruling habitudes. The
men are more finely formed than the women, the latter
being short, thick, and disproportionately large in their
lower limbs. In their persons they are slovenly; in
their dispositions, lively and contented. As they are
able to procure food<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> with but little labor, they are
naturally indolent, but appear to be able and willing to
work when occasion requires it. Their relations with
white people have been for the most part amicable; they
are seldom quarrelsome, though not lacking bravery.
The people are called after the name of the village in
which they dwell. Their primitive costume consists of
hare, musk-rat, badger, and beaver skins, sometimes cut
into strips an inch broad, and woven or interlaced. The
nose is perforated by both sexes, the men suspending
therefrom a brass, copper, or shell ornament, the women
a wooden one, tipped with a bead at either end.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Their
avarice lies in the direction of hiaqua shells, which find
their way up from the sea-coast through other tribes.
In 1810, these beads were the circulating medium of the
country, and twenty of them would buy a good beaver-skin.
Their paint is made of vermilion obtained from
the traders, or of a pulverized red stone mixed with
grease. They are greatly addicted to gambling, and do
not appear at all dejected by ill fortune, spending days
and nights in the winter season at their games, frequently
gambling away every rag of clothing and every trinket
in their possession. They also stake parts of a garment
or other article, and if losers, cut off a piece of coat-sleeve
or a foot of gun-barrel. Native cooking vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
are made of bark, or of the roots or fibres of trees, woven
so as to hold water, in which are placed heated stones
for the purpose of cooking food.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Polygamy is practiced,
but not generally. The Tacullies are fond of their
wives, performing the most of the household drudgery
in order to relieve them, and consequently they are very
jealous of them. But to their unmarried daughters,
strange as it may seem, they allow every liberty without
censure or shame. The reason which they give for this
strange custom is, that the purity of their wives is thereby
better preserved.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>During a portion of every year the Tacullies dwell in
villages, conveniently situated for catching and drying
salmon. In April they visit the lakes and take small
fish; and after these fail, they return to their villages
and subsist upon the fish they have dried, and upon
herbs and berries. From August to October, salmon are
plentiful again. Beaver are caught in nets made from
strips of cariboo-skins, and also in cypress and steel
traps. They are also sometimes shot with guns or with
bows and arrows. Smaller game they take in various
kinds of traps.</p>

<p>The civil polity of the Tacullies is of a very primitive
character. Any person may become a <i>miuty</i> or chief
who will occasionally provide a village feast. A malefactor
may find protection from the avenger in the dwelling
of a chief, so long as he is permitted to remain there,
or even afterwards if he has upon his back any one of the
chief's garments. Disputes are usually adjusted by some
old man of the tribe. The boundaries of the territories
belonging to the different villages are designated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
mountains, rivers, or other natural objects, and the
rights of towns, as well as of individuals, are most generally
respected; but broils are constantly occasioned by
murders, abduction of women, and other causes, between
these separate societies.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>When seriously ill, the Carriers deem it an indispensable
condition to their recovery that every secret
crime should be confessed to the magician. Murder, of
any but a member of the same village, is not considered
a heinous offense. They at first believed reading
and writing to be the exercise of magic art. The
Carriers know little of medicinal herbs. Their priest or
magician is also the doctor, but before commencing his
operations in the sick room, he must receive a fee, which,
if his efforts prove unsuccessful, he is obliged to restore.
The curative process consists in singing a melancholy
strain over the invalid, in which all around join. This
mitigates pain, and often restores health. Their winter
tenements are frequently made by opening a spot of
earth to the depth of two feet, across which a ridge-pole
is placed, supported at either end by posts; poles are
then laid from the sides of the excavation to the ridge-pole
and covered with hay. A hole is left in the top for
purposes of entrance and exit, and also in order to allow
the escape of smoke.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Slavery is common with them; all who can afford it
keeping slaves. They use them as beasts of burden, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
treat them most inhumanly. The country of the Sicannis
in the Rocky Mountains is sterile, yielding the occupants
a scanty supply of food and clothing. They are
nevertheless devotedly attached to their bleak land, and
will fight for their rude homes with the most patriotic
ardor.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NEHANNES AND TALKOTINS.</p>

<p>The Nehannes usually pass the summer in the vicinity
of the sea-coast, and scour the interior during the
winter for furs, which they obtain from inland tribes
by barter or plunder, and dispose of to the European
traders. It is not a little remarkable that this warlike
and turbulent horde was at one time governed by a
woman. Fame gives her a fair complexion, with regular
features, and great intelligence. Her influence over her
fiery people, it is said, was perfect; while her warriors, the
terror and scourge of the surrounding country, quailed
before her eye. Her word was law, and was obeyed with
marvelous alacrity. Through her influence the condition
of the women of her tribe was greatly raised.</p>

<p>Great ceremonies, cruelty, and superstition attend
burning the dead, which custom obtains throughout this
region,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and, as usual in savagism, woman is the sufferer.
When the father of a household dies, the entire
family, or, if a chief, the tribe, are summoned to present
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Time must be given to those most distant
to reach the village before the ceremony begins.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The
Talkotin wife, when all is ready, is compelled to ascend the
funeral pile, throw herself upon her husband's body and
there remain until nearly suffocated, when she is permitted
to descend. Still she must keep her place near the burning
corpse, keep it in a proper position, tend the fire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
if through pain or faintness she fails in the performance
of her duties, she is held up and pressed forward by
others; her cries meanwhile are drowned in wild songs,
accompanied by the beating of drums.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>When the funeral pile of a Tacully is fired, the wives
of the deceased, if there are more than one, are placed
at the head and foot of the body. Their duty there is
to publicly demonstrate their affection for the departed;
which they do by resting their head upon the dead bosom,
by striking in frenzied love the body, nursing and battling
the fire meanwhile. And there they remain until
the hair is burned from their head, until, suffocated and
almost senseless, they stagger off to a little distance; then
recovering, attack the corpse with new vigor, striking it
first with one hand and then with the other, until the
form of the beloved is reduced to ashes. Finally these
ashes are gathered up, placed in sacks, and distributed
one sack to each wife, whose duty it is to carry upon her
person the remains of the departed for the space of two
years. During this period of mourning the women are
clothed in rags, kept in a kind of slavery, and not allowed
to marry. Not unfrequently these poor creatures
avoid their term of servitude by suicide. At the expiration
of the time, a feast is given them, and they are
again free. Structures are erected as repositories for the
ashes of their dead,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> in which the bag or box containing
the remains is placed. These grave-houses are of
split boards about one inch in thickness, six feet high,
and decorated with painted representations of various
heavenly and earthly objects.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Rocky Mountains burn with the
deceased all his effects, and even those of his nearest
relatives, so that it not unfrequently happens that a
family is reduced to absolute starvation in the dead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
winter, when it is impossible to procure food. The motive
assigned to this custom is, that there may be nothing
left to bring the dead to remembrance.</p>

<p>A singular custom prevails among the Nateotetain
women, which is to cut off one joint of a finger upon
the death of a near relative. In consequence of this
practice some old women may be seen with two joints
off every finger on both hands. The men bear their
sorrows more stoically, being content in such cases with
shaving the head and cutting their flesh with flints.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">KUTCHIN CHARACTERISTICS.</p>

<p>The Kutchins are the flower of the Tinneh family.
They are very numerous, numbering about twenty-two
tribes. They are a more noble and manly people than
either the Eskimos upon the north or the contiguous
Tinneh tribes upon their own southern boundary. The
finest specimens dwell on the Yukon River. The women
tattoo the chin with a black pigment, and the men draw
a black stripe down the forehead and nose, frequently
crossing the forehead and cheeks with red lines, and
streaking the chin alternately with red and black. Their
features are more regular than those of their neighbors,
more expressive of boldness, frankness, and candor; their
foreheads higher, and their complexions lighter. The
Tenan Kutchin of the Tananah River, one of the largest
tribes of the Yukon Valley, are somewhat wilder and
more ferocious in their appearance. The boys are precocious,
and the girls marry at fifteen.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The Kutchins
of Peel River, as observed by Mr Isbister, "are an athletic
and fine-looking race; considerable above the average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
stature, most of them being upwards of six feet in
height and remarkably well proportioned."</p>

<p>Their clothing is made from the skins of reindeer,
dressed with the hair on; their coat cut after the fashion
of the Eskimos, with skirts peaked before and behind,
and elaborately trimmed with beads and dyed porcupine-quills.
The Kutchins, in common with the Eskimos,
are distinguished by a similarity in the costume of the
sexes. Men and women wear the same description of
breeches. Some of the men have a long flap attached to
their deer-skin shirts, shaped like a beaver's tail, and
reaching nearly to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Of the coat, Mr
Whymper says: "If the reader will imagine a man
dressed in two swallow-tailed coats, one of them worn
as usual, the other covering his stomach and buttoned
behind, he will get some idea of this garment." Across
the shoulders and breast they wear a broad band of
beads, with narrower bands round the forehead and
ankles, and along the seams of their leggins. They are
great traders; beads are their wealth, used in the place
of money, and the rich among them literally load themselves
with necklaces and strings of various patterns.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
The nose and ears are adorned with shells.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The hair
is worn in a long cue, ornamented with feathers, and
bound with strings of beads and shells at the head, with
flowing ends, and so saturated with grease and birds'
down as to swell it sometimes to the thickness of the
neck. They pay considerable attention to personal cleanliness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
The Kutchins construct both permanent underground
dwellings and the temporary summer-hut or
tent.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE KUTCHINS.</p>

<p>On the Yukon, the greatest scarcity of food is in the
spring. The winter's stores are exhausted, and the bright
rays of the sun upon the melting snow almost blind the
eyes of the deer-hunter. The most plentiful supply of
game is in August, September, and October, after which
the forming of ice on the rivers prevents fishing until
December, when the winter traps are set. The reindeer
are in good condition in August, and geese are plentiful.
Salmon ascend the river in June, and are taken in great
quantities until about the first of September; fish are
dried or smoked without salt, for winter use. Fur-hunting
begins in October; and in December, trade
opens with the Eskimos, with whom furs are exchanged
for oil and seal-skins.</p>

<p>The Kutchin of the Yukon are unacquainted with
nets, but catch their fish by means of weirs or stakes
planted across rivers and narrow lakes, having openings
for wicker baskets, by which they intercept the fish.
They hunt reindeer in the mountains and take moose-deer
in snares.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Both Kutchins and Eskimos are very jealous regarding
their boundaries; but the incessant warfare which is
maintained between the littoral and interior people of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
northern coast near the Mackenzie river, is not maintained
by the north-western tribes. One of either people,
however, if found hunting out of his own territory,
is very liable to be shot. Some Kutchin tribes permit
the Eskimos to take the meat of the game which they kill,
provided they leave the skin at the nearest village.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The Kutchins of the Yukon River manufacture cups
and pots from clay, and ornament them with crosses,
dots, and lines; moulding them by hand after various
patterns, first drying them in the sun and then baking
them. The Eskimo lamp is also sometimes made of clay.
The Tinneh make paint of pulverized colored stones or of
earth, mixed with glue. The glue is made from buffalo
feet and applied by a moose-hair brush.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of their boats the Kutchins of the
Yukon use bark as a substitute for the seal-skins of the
coast. They first make a light frame of willow or birch,
from eight to sixteen feet in length. Then with fine
spruce-fir roots they sew together strips of birch bark,
cover the frame, and calk the seams with spruce gum.
They are propelled by single paddles or poles. Those of
the Mackenzie River are after the same pattern.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>In absence of law, murder and all other crimes are compounded
for.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> A man to be well married must be either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
rich or strong. A good hunter, who can accumulate
beads, and a good wrestler, who can win brides by force,
may have from two to five wives. The women perform
all domestic duties, and eat after the husband is satisfied,
but the men paddle the boats, and have even been known
to carry their wives ashore so that they might not wet
their feet. The women carry their infants in a sort of
bark saddle, fastened to their back; they bandage their
feet in order to keep them small.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Kutchin amusements
are wrestling, leaping, dancing, and singing. They are
great talkers, and etiquette forbids any interruption to
the narrative of a new comer.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE TENAN KUTCHIN.</p>

<p>The Tenan Kutchin, 'people of the mountains,' inhabiting
the country south of Fort Yukon which is
drained by the river Tananah, are a wild, ungovernable
horde, their territory never yet having been invaded by
white people. The river upon which they dwell is supposed
to take its rise near the upper Yukon. They allow
no women in their deer-hunting expeditions. They
smear their leggins and hair with red ochre and grease.
The men part their hair in the middle and separate it
into locks, which, when properly dressed, look like rolls
of red mud about the size of a finger; one bunch of
locks is secured in a mass which falls down the neck, by
a band of dentalium shells, and two smaller rolls hang
down either side of the face. After being soaked in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
grease and tied, the head is powdered with finely cut
swan's down, which adheres to the greasy hair. The
women wear few ornaments, perform more than the ordinary
amount of drudgery, and are treated more like
dogs than human beings. Chastity is scarcely known
among them. The Kutcha Kutchin, 'people of the lowland,'
are cleaner and better mannered.</p>

<p>The Kutchins have a singular system of totems. The
whole nation is divided into three castes, called respectively
<i>Chitcheah</i>, <i>Tengratsey</i>, and <i>Natsahi</i>, each occupying
a distinct territory. Two persons of the same
caste are not allowed to marry; but a man of one caste
must marry a woman of another. The mother gives
caste to the children, so that as the fathers die off the
caste of the country constantly changes. This system
operates strongly against war between tribes; as in war,
it is caste against caste, and not tribe against tribe. As
the father is never of the same caste as the son, who receives
caste from his mother, there can never be intertribal
war without ranging fathers and sons against each
other. When a child is named, the father drops his
former name and substitutes that of the child, so that
the father receives his name from the child, and not the
child from the father.</p>

<p>They have scarcely any government; their chiefs are
elected on account of wealth or ability, and their authority
is very limited.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Their custom is to burn the
dead, and enclose the ashes in a box placed upon posts;
some tribes enclose the body in an elevated box without
burning.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE KENAI.</p>

<p>The Kenai are a fine, manly race, in which Baer distinguishes
characteristics decidedly American, and clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
distinct from the Asiatic Eskimos. One of the most powerful
Kenai tribes is the Unakatanas, who dwell upon the
Koyukuk River, and plant their villages along the banks
of the lower Yukon for a distance of one hundred and
fifty miles. They are bold and ferocious, dominative
even to the giving of fashion in dress.</p>

<p>That part of the Yukon which runs through their territory
abounds with moose, which during the summer
frequent the water in order to avoid the mosquitos, and
as the animals are clumsy swimmers, the Indians easily
capture them. Their women occupy a very inferior position,
being obliged to do more drudgery and embellish
their dress with fewer ornaments than those of the upper
tribes. The men wear a heavy fringe of beads or shells
upon their dress, equal sometimes to two hundred marten-skins
in value.</p>

<p>At Nuklukahyet, where the Tananah River joins the
Yukon, is a neutral trading-ground to which all the surrounding
tribes resort in the spring for traffic. Skins
are their moneyed currency, the beaver-skin being the
standard; one 'made' beaver-skin represents two marten-skins.</p>

<p>The Ingaliks inhabiting the Yukon near its mouth call
themselves <i>Kaeyah Khatana</i>. Their dialect is totally
distinct from the Malemutes, their neighbors on the
west, but shows an affinity with that of the Unakatanas
to their east. Tobacco they both smoke and snuff. The
smoke they swallow; snuff is drawn into the nostrils
through a wooden tube. They manufacture snuff from
leaf tobacco by means of a wooden mortar and pestle,
and carry bone or wooden snuff-boxes. They are described
by travelers as a timid, sensitive people, and
remarkably honest. Ingalik women are delivered kneeling,
and without pain, being seldom detained from their
household duties for more than an hour. The infant
is washed, greased, and fed, and is seldom weaned under
two or three years. The women live longer than the
men; some of them reaching sixty, while the men rarely
attain more than forty-five years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>The Koltschanes, whose name in the dialect of the
Kenai signifies 'guest,' and in that of the Atnas of Copper
River, 'stranger,' have been charged with great cruelty,
and even cannibalism, but without special foundation.
Wrangell believes the Koltschanes, Atnas, and
Kolosches to be one people.</p>

<p>The Kenai, of the Kenaian peninsula, upon recovery
from dangerous illness, give a feast to those who expressed
sympathy during the affliction. If a bounteous
provision is made upon these occasions, a chieftainship
may be obtained thereby; and although the power thus
acquired does not descend to one's heir, he may be conditionally
recognized as chief. Injuries are avenged by
the nearest relative, but if a murder is committed by a
member of another clan, all the allied families rise to
avenge the wrong. When a person dies, the whole community
assemble and mourn. The nearest kinsman, arrayed
in his best apparel, with blackened face, his nose
and head decked with eagle's feathers, leads the ceremony.
All sit round a fire and howl, while the master
of the lamentation recounts the notable deeds of the
departed, amidst the ringing of bells, and violent stampings,
and contortions of his body. The clothing is then
distributed to the relatives, the body is burned, the bones
collected and interred, and at the expiration of a year a
feast is held to the memory of the deceased, after which
it is not lawful for a relative to mention his name.</p>

<p>The lover, if his suit is accepted, must perform a
year's service for his bride. The wooing is in this wise:
early some morning he enters the abode of the fair one's
father, and without speaking a word proceeds to bring
water, prepare food, and to heat the bath-room. In reply
to the question why he performs these services, he
answers that he desires the daughter for a wife. At the
expiration of the year, without further ceremony, he
takes her home, with a gift; but if she is not well treated
by her husband, she may return to her father, and take
with her the dowry. The wealthy may have several
wives, but the property of each wife is distinct. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
are nomadic in their inclinations and traverse the interior
to a considerable distance in pursuit of game.</p>

<p>The Atnas are a small tribe inhabiting the Atna or
Copper River. They understand the art of working
copper, and have commercial relations with surrounding
tribes. In the spring, before the breaking up of ice upon
the lakes and rivers, they hunt reindeer, driving them
into angle-shaped wicker-work corrals, where they are
killed. In the autumn another general hunt takes place,
when deer are driven into lakes, and pursued and killed
in boats. Their food and clothing depend entirely upon
their success in these forays, as they are unable to obtain
fish in sufficient quantities for their sustenance; and when
unsuccessful in the chase, whole families die of starvation.
Those who can afford it, keep slaves, buying them
from the Koltschanes. They burn their dead, then carefully
collect the ashes in a new reindeer-skin, enclose the
skin in a box, and place the box on posts or in a tree.
Every year they celebrate a feast in commemoration of
their dead. Baer asserts that the Atnas divide the year
into fifteen months, which are designated only by their
numbers; ten of them belong to autumn and winter, and
five to spring and summer.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TINNEH CHARACTER.</p>

<p>The Tinneh character, if we may accept the assertions
of various travelers, visiting different parts under widely
different circumstances, presents a multitude of phases.
Thus it is said of the Chepewyans by Mackenzie, that
they are "sober, timorous, and vagrant, with a selfish
disposition which has sometimes created suspicions of
their integrity. They are also of a quarrelous disposition,
and are continually making complaints which they
express by a constant repetition of the word <i>edmy</i>, 'it is
hard,' in a whiny and plaintive tone of voice. So indolent
that numbers perish every year from famine. Suicide
is not uncommon among them." Hearne asserts
that they are morose and covetous; that they have no
gratitude; are great beggars; are insolent, if any respect
is shown them; that they cheat on all opportunities; yet
they are mild, rarely get drunk; and "never proceed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
violence beyond bad language;" that they steal on every
opportunity from the whites, but very rarely from each
other; and although regarding all property, including
wives, as belonging to the strongest, yet they only wrestle,
and rarely murder. Of the same people Sir John
Franklin says, that they are naturally indolent, selfish,
and great beggars. "I never saw men," he writes, "who
either received or bestowed a gift with such bad grace."
The Dog-ribs are "of a mild, hospitable, but rather indolent
disposition," fond of dancing and singing. According
to the same traveler the Copper Indians are superior,
in personal character, to any other Chepewyans.
"Their delicate and humane attentions to us," he remarks,
"in a period of great distress, are indelibly engraven
on our memories." Simpson says that it is a
general rule among the traders not to believe the first
story of an Indian. Although sometimes bearing suffering
with fortitude, the least sickness makes them say, "I am
going to die," and the improvidence of the Indian character
is greatly aggravated by the custom of destroying
all the property of deceased relatives. Sir John Richardson
accuses the Hare Indians of timidity, standing in
great fear of the Eskimos, and being always in want
of food. They are practical socialists, 'great liars,' but
'strictly honest.' Hospitality is not a virtue with them.
According to Richardson, neither the Eskimos, Dog-ribs,
nor Hare Indians, feel the least shame in being detected
in falsehood, and invariably practice it if they think
that they can thereby gain any of their petty ends.
Even in their familiar intercourse with each other, the
Indians seldom tell the truth in the first instance, and if
they succeed in exciting admiration or astonishment,
their invention runs on without check. From the manner
of the speaker, rather than by his words, is his truth
or falsehood inferred, and often a very long interrogation
is necessary to elicit the real fact. The comfort, and
not unfrequently even the lives of parties of the timid
Hare Indians are sacrificed by this miserable propensity.
The Hare and Dog-rib women are certainly at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
bottom of the scale of humanity in North America.
Ross thinks that they are "tolerably honest; not bloodthirsty,
nor cruel;" "confirmed liars, far from being
chaste."</p>

<p>According to Harmon, one of the earliest and most
observing travelers among them, the Tacullies "are a
quiet, inoffensive people," and "perhaps the most honest
on the face of the earth." They "are unusually talkative,"
and "take great delight in singing or humming
or whistling a dull air." "Murder is not considered as
a crime of great magnitude." He considers the Sicannis
the bravest of the Tacully tribes.</p>

<p>But the Kutchins bear off the palm for honesty. Says
Whymper: "Finding the loads too great for our dogs, we
raised an erection of poles, and deposited some bags
thereon. I may here say, once for all, that our men
often left goods, consisting of tea, flour, molasses, bacon,
and all kinds of miscellaneous articles, scattered in this
way over the country, and that they remained untouched
by the Indians, who frequently traveled past
them." Simpson testifies of the Loucheux that "a
bloody intent with them lurks not under a smile."
Murray reports the Kutchins treacherous; Richardson
did not find them so. Jones declares that "they differ
entirely from the Tinneh tribes of the Mackenzie, being
generous, honest, hospitable, proud, high-spirited, and
quick to revenge an injury."</p>

<h4><a name="TRIBAL_I" id="TRIBAL_I"></a>TRIBAL BOUNDARIES.</h4>

<div class="tribal">
<p>Accurately to draw partition lines between primitive nations is impossible.
Migrating with the seasons, constantly at war, driving and being driven far
past the limits of hereditary boundaries, extirpating and being extirpated,
overwhelming, intermingling; like a human sea, swelling and surging in its
wild struggle with the winds of fate, they come and go, here to-day, yonder
to-morrow. A traveler passing over the country finds it inhabited by certain
tribes; another coming after finds all changed. One writer gives certain
names to certain nations; another changes the name, or gives to the nation
a totally different locality. An approximation, however, can be made sufficiently
correct for practical purposes; and to arrive at this, I will give at
the end of each chapter all the authorities at my command; that from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
statements of all, whether conflicting or otherwise, the truth may be very
nearly arrived at. All nations, north of the fifty-fifth parallel, as before
mentioned, I call Hyperboreans.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">To the Eskimos</span>, I give the Arctic sea-board from the Coppermine River
to Kotzebue Sound. Late travelers make a distinction between the Malemutes
and Kaveaks of Norton Sound and the Eskimos. Whymper calls the
former 'a race of tall and stout people, but in other respect, much resembling
the Esquimaux.' <i>Alaska</i>, p. 159. Sir John Richardson, in his <i>Journal</i>,
vol. i., p. 341, places them on the 'western coast, by Cook's Sound and Tchugatz
Bay, nearly to Mount St. Elias;' but in his <i>Polar Regions</i>, p. 299, he
terminates them at Kotzebue Sound. Early writers give them the widest
scope. 'Die südlichsten sind in Amerika, auf der Küste Labrador, wo nach
Charlevoix dieser Völkerstamm den Namen Esquimaux bey den in der Nähe
wohnenden Abenaki führte, und auch an der benachbarten Ostseite von Neu-Fundland,
ferner westlich noch unter der Halbinsel Alaska.' <i>Vater</i>, <i>Mithridates</i>,
vol. iii., pt. iii., p. 425. Dr Latham, in his <i>Varieties of Man</i>, treats
the inhabitants of the Aleutian Islands as Eskimos, and in <i>Native Races
of the Russian Empire</i>, p. 289, he gives them 'the whole of the coast of the
Arctic Ocean, and the coast from Behring Strait to Cook Inlet.' Prichard,
<i>Researches</i>, vol. v., p. 371, requires more complete evidence before he can
conclude that the Aleuts are not Eskimos. Being entirely unacquainted
with the great Kutchin family in the Yukon Valley, he makes the Carriers of
New Caledonia conterminous with the Eskimos. The boundary lines between
the Eskimos and the interior Indian tribes 'are generally formed by
the summit of the watershed between the small rivers which empty into the
sea and those which fall into the Yukon.' <i>Dall's Alaska</i>, p. 144. Malte-Brun,
<i>Précis de la Géographie</i>, vol. v., p. 317, goes to the other extreme. 'Les Esquimaux,'
he declares, 'habitent depuis le golfe Welcome jusqu'au fleuve Mackenzie,
et probablement jusqu'au détroit de Bering; ils s'étendent au sud jusqu'au
lac de l'Esclave.' Ludewig, <i>Aboriginal Languages</i>, p. 69, divides them into 'Eskimo
proper, on the shores of Labrador, and the Western Eskimos.' Gallatin
sweepingly asserts that 'they are the sole native inhabitants of the shores of
all the seas, bays, inlets, and islands of America, north of the sixtieth degree
of north latitude.' <i>Am. Antiq. Soc. Transact.</i>, vol. ii., p. 9. The Western
Eskimos, says Beechey, 'inhabit the north-west coast of America, from 60° 34´
N. to 71° 24´ N.' <i>Voy.</i>, vol. ii., p. 299. 'Along the entire coast of America.'
<i>Armstrong's Nar.</i>, p. 191.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ESKIMOS AND KONIAGAS.</p>

<p>The tribal subdivisions of the Eskimos are as follows:&mdash;At Coppermine
River they are known by the name of <i>Naggeuktoomutes</i>, 'deer-horns.' At the
eastern outlet of the Mackenzie they are called <i>Kittear</i>. Between the Mackenzie
River and Barter Reef they call themselves <i>Kangmali-Innuin</i>. The
tribal name at Point Barrow is <i>Nuwangmeun</i>. 'The <i>Nuna-tangmë-un</i> inhabit
the country traversed by the Nunatok, a river which falls into Kotzebue
Sound.' <i>Richardson's Pol. Reg.</i>, p. 300. From Cape Lisburn to Icy Cape the
tribal appellation is <i>Kitegues</i>. 'Deutsche Karten zeigen uns noch im Nord-west-Ende
des russischen Nordamerika's, in dieser so anders gewandten
Küstenlinie, nördlich vom Kotzebue-Sund: im westlichen Theile des Küstenlandes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
dass sie West-Georgien nennen, vom Cap Lisburn bis über das Eiscap;
hinlaufend das Volk der Kiteguen.' <i>Buschmann</i>, <i>Spuren der Aztek. Sprache</i>,

<p>The <i>Kutchins</i> are a large nation, extending from the Mackenzie River
westward along the Yukon Valley to near the mouth of the river, with the
Eskimos on one side and the Koltshanes on the other. Buschmann, <i>Spuren

Nordamerika an.' They are located 'immediately to the northward of the
Hare Indians on both banks of Mackenzie's River.' <i>Franklin's Nar.</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 83. Gallatin, <i>Am. Antiq. Soc. Transact.</i>, vol. ii., p. 83, places their northern
boundary in latitude 67° 27´. To the west of the Mackenzie the Loucheux
interpose between the Esquimaux 'and the Tinné, and spread westward
until they come into the neighborhood of the coast tribes of Beering's
Sea.' <i>Richardson's Jour.</i>, vol. i., p. 377. 'The Kutchin may be said to inhabit
the territory extending from the Mackenzie, at the mouth of Peel's
River, lat. 68°, long. 134°, to Norton's sound, living principally upon the
banks of the Youcon and Porcupine Rivers, though several of the tribes are
situated far inland, many days' journey from either river.' <i>Jones</i>, in <i>Smithsonian
Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 320. 'They commence somewhere about the 65th degree of
north latitude, and stretch westward from the Mackenzie to Behring's straits.'
'They are divided into many petty tribes, each having its own chief, as the Tatlit-Kutchin
(Peel River Indians), Ta-Kuth-Kutchin (Lapiene's House Indians),
Kutch-a-Kutchin (Youcan Indians), Touchon-ta-Kutchin (Wooded-country

<p>The term <span class="smcap">Columbians</span>, or, as Scouler<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and others have
called them, <i>Nootka-Columbians</i>, is, in the absence of a
native word, sufficiently characteristic to distinguish the
aboriginal nations of north-western America between the
forty-third and fifty-fifth parallels, from those of the other
great divisions of this work. The Columbia River, which
suggests the name of this group, and Nootka Sound on
the western shore of Vancouver Island, were originally
the chief centres of European settlement on the North-west
Coast; and at an early period these names were
compounded to designate the natives of the Anglo-American
possessions on the Pacific, which lay between the
discoveries of the Russians on the north and those of
the Spaniards on the south. As a simple name is always
preferable to a complex one, and as no more pertinent
name suggests itself than that of the great river
which, with its tributaries, drains a large portion of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
territory, I drop 'Nootka' and retain only the word
'Columbian.'<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> These nations have also been broadly
denominated Flatheads, from a custom practiced more or
less by many of their tribes, of compressing the cranium
during infancy;<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> although the only Indians in the whole
area, tribally known as Flatheads, are those of the Salish
family, who do not flatten the head at all.</p>

<p class="sidenote">COLUMBIAN FAMILIES.</p>

<p>In describing the Columbian nations it is necessary,
as in the other divisions, to subdivide the group; arbitrarily
this may have been done in some instances, but
as naturally as possible in all. Thus the people of Queen
Charlotte Islands, and the adjacent coast for about a
hundred miles inland, extending from 55° to 52° of north
latitude, are called <i>Haidahs</i> from the predominant tribe
of the islands. The occupants of Vancouver Island and
the opposite main, with its labyrinth of inlets from 52°
to 49°, I term <i>Nootkas</i>. The <i>Sound Indians</i> inhabit the
region drained by streams flowing into Puget Sound, and
the adjacent shores of the strait and ocean; the <i>Chinooks</i>
occupy the banks of the Columbia from the Dalles to the
sea, extending along the coast northward to Gray Harbor,
and southward nearly to the Californian line. The
interior of British Columbia, between the Cascade and
Rocky Mountains, and south of the territory occupied by
the Hyperborean Carriers, is peopled by the <i>Shushwaps</i>,
the <i>Kootenais</i>, and the <i>Okanagans</i>. Between 49° and 47°,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
extending west from the Cascade to the Rocky Mountains,
chiefly on the Columbia and Clarke Fork, is the <i>Salish</i> or
Flathead family. The nations dwelling south of 47° and
east of the Cascade range, on the Columbia, the lower Snake,
and their tributary streams, may be called <i>Sahaptins</i>, from
the name of the Nez Percé tribes.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The great <i>Shoshone</i>
family, extending south-east from the upper waters of the
Columbia, and spreading out over nearly the whole of the
Great Basin, although partially included in the Columbian
limits, will be omitted in this, and included in the
Californian Group, which follows. These divisions, as
before stated, are geographic rather than ethnographic.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Many attempts have been made by practical ethnologists,
to draw partition lines between these peoples according
to race, all of which have proved signal failures, the best
approximation to a scientific division being that of philologists,
the results of whose researches are given in the
third volume of this series; but neither the latter division,
nor that into coast and inland tribes&mdash;in many respects
the most natural and clearly defined of all<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>&mdash;is
adapted to my present purpose. In treating of the Columbians,
I shall first take up the coast families, going
from north to south, and afterward follow the same order
with those east of the mountains.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HOME OF THE COLUMBIANS.</p>

<p>No little partiality was displayed by the Great Spirit
of the Columbians in the apportionment of their dwelling-place.
The Cascade Mountains, running from north
to south throughout their whole territory, make of it two
distinct climatic divisions, both highly but unequally
favored by nature. On the coast side&mdash;a strip which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
may be called one hundred and fifty miles wide and one
thousand miles long&mdash;excessive cold is unknown, and
the earth, warmed by Asiatic currents and watered by
numerous mountain streams, is thickly wooded; noble
forests are well stocked with game; a fertile soil yields a
great variety of succulent roots and edible berries, which
latter means of subsistence were lightly appreciated by the
indolent inhabitants, by reason of the still more abundant
and accessible food-supply afforded by the fish of
ocean, channel, and stream. The sources of material for
clothing were also bountiful far beyond the needs of the
people.</p>

<p>Passing the Cascade barrier, the climate and the face
of the country change. Here we have a succession of
plains or table-lands, rarely degenerating into deserts,
with a good supply of grass and roots; though generally
without timber, except along the streams, until the
heavily wooded western spurs of the Rocky Mountains
are reached. The air having lost much of its moisture,
affords but a scanty supply of rain, the warming and
equalizing influence of the ocean stream is no longer felt,
and the extremes of heat and cold are undergone according
to latitude and season. Yet are the dwellers in this
land blessed above many other aboriginal peoples, in that
game is plenty, and roots and insects are at hand in case
the season's hunt prove unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Ethnologically, no well-defined line can be drawn to
divide the people occupying these two widely different
regions. Diverse as they certainly are in form, character,
and customs, their environment, the climate, and their
methods of seeking food may well be supposed to have
made them so. Not only do the pursuit of game in the
interior and the taking of fish on the coast, develop
clearly marked general peculiarities of character and life
in the two divisions, but the same causes produce grades
more or less distinct in each division. West of the Cascade
range, the highest position is held by the tribes who
in their canoes pursue the whale upon the ocean, and in
the effort to capture Leviathan become themselves great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
and daring as compared with the lowest order who live
upon shell-fish and whatever nutritious substances may
be cast by the tide upon the beach. Likewise in the interior,
the extremes are found in the deer, bear, elk, and
buffalo hunters, especially when horses are employed, and
in the root and insect eaters of the plains. Between these
four extreme classes may be traced many intermediate
grades of physical and intellectual development, due to
necessity and the abilities exercised in the pursuit of game.</p>

<p>The Columbians hitherto have been brought in much
closer contact with the whites than the Hyperboreans,
and the results of the association are known to all. The
cruel treacheries and massacres by which nations have
been thinned, and flickering remnants of once powerful
tribes gathered on government reservations or reduced
to a handful of beggars, dependent for a livelihood on
charity, theft, or the wages of prostitution, form an unwritten
chapter in the history of this region. That this
process of duplicity was unnecessary as well as infamous,
I shall not attempt to show, as the discussion of
Indian policy forms no part of my present purpose.
Whatever the cause, whether from an inhuman civilized
policy, or the decrees of fate, it is evident that the Columbians,
in common with all the aborigines of America,
are doomed to extermination. Civilization and savagism
will not coalesce, any more than light and darkness; and
although it may be necessary that these things come, yet
are those by whom they are unrighteously accomplished
none the less culpable.</p>

<p>Once more let it be understood that the time of which
this volume speaks, was when the respective peoples were
first known to Europeans. It was when, throughout
this region of the Columbia, nature's wild magnificence
was yet fresh; primeval forests unprofaned; lakes, and
rivers, and rolling plains unswept; it was when countless
villages dotted the luxuriant valleys; when from
the warrior's camp-fire the curling smoke never ceased
to ascend, nor the sounds of song and dance to be heard;
when bands of gaily dressed savages roamed over every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
hill-side; when humanity unrestrained vied with bird
and beast in the exercise of liberty absolute. This is
no history; alas! they have none; it is but a sun-picture,
and to be taken correctly must be taken quickly. Nor
need we pause to look back through the dark vista of
unwritten history, and speculate, who and what they are,
nor for how many thousands of years they have been coming
and going, counting the winters, the moons, and the
sleeps; chasing the wild game, basking in the sunshine,
pursuing and being pursued, killing and being killed.
All knowledge regarding them lies buried in an eternity
of the past, as all knowledge of their successors remains
folded in an eternity of the future. We came upon
them unawares, unbidden, and while we gazed they
melted away. The infectious air of civilization penetrated
to the remotest corner of their solitudes. Their
ignorant and credulous nature, unable to cope with the
intellect of a superior race, absorbed only its vices, yielding
up its own simplicity and nobleness for the white
man's diseases and death.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HAIDAH NATIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">In the <span class="smcap">Haidah</span> family I include the nations occupying
the coast and islands from the southern extremity of
Prince of Wales Archipelago to the Bentinck Arms in
about 52°. Their territory is bounded on the north and
east by the Thlinkeet and Carrier nations of the Hyperboreans,
and on the south by the Nootka family of the
Columbians. Its chief nations, whose boundaries however
can rarely be fixed with precision, are the <i>Massets</i>,
the <i>Skiddegats</i>, and the <i>Cumshawas</i>, of Queen Charlotte
Islands; the <i>Kaiganies</i>, of Prince of Wales Archipelago;
the <i>Chimsyans</i>, about Fort Simpson, and on Chatham
Sound; the <i>Nass</i> and the <i>Skeenas</i>, on the rivers of the
same names; the <i>Sebassas</i>, on Pitt Archipelago and the
shores of Gardner Channel; and the Millbank Sound Indians,
including the <i>Hailtzas</i> and the <i>Bellacoolas</i>, the most
southern of this family. These nations, the orthography
of whose names is far from uniform among different writers,
are still farther subdivided into numerous indefinite
tribes, as specified at the <a href="#TRIBAL_III">end of this chapter.</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>The Haidah territory, stretching on the mainland three
hundred miles in length, and in width somewhat over
one hundred miles from the sea to the lofty Chilkoten
Plain, is traversed throughout its length by the northern
extension of the Cascade Range. In places its spurs and
broken foot-hills touch the shore, and the very heart of
the range is penetrated by innumerable inlets and channels,
into which pour short rapid streams from interior
hill and plain. The country, though hilly, is fertile
and covered by an abundant growth of large, straight
pines, cedars, and other forest trees. The forest abounds
with game, the waters with fish. The climate is less severe
than in the middle United States; and notwithstanding
the high latitude of their home, the Haidahs
have received no small share of nature's gifts. Little
has been explored, however, beyond the actual coast,
and information concerning this nation, coming from a
few sources only, is less complete than in the case of the
more southern Nootkas.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL PECULIARITIES OF THE HAIDAHS.</p>

<p>Favorable natural conditions have produced in the Haidahs
a tall, comely, and well-formed race, not inferior to
any in North-western America;<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> the northern nations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the family being generally superior to the southern,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
and having physical if not linguistic affinities with their
Thlinkeet neighbors, rather than with the Nootkas.
Their faces are broad, with high cheek bones;<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> the eyes
small, generally black, though brown and gray with a
reddish tinge have been observed among them.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> The
few who have seen their faces free from paint pronounce
their complexion light,<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and instances of Albino characteristics
are sometimes found.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The hair is not uniformly
coarse and black, but often soft in texture, and of
varying shades of brown, worn by some of the tribes cut
close to the head.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The beard is usually plucked out
with great care, but moustaches are raised sometimes as
strong as those of Europeans;<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> indeed there seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
be little authority for the old belief that the North-western
American Indians were destitute of hair except
on the head.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Dr Scouler, comparing Chimsyan skulls
with those of the Chinooks, who are among the best
known of the north-western nations, finds that in a natural
state both have broad, high cheek-bones, with a receding
forehead, but the Chimsyan skull, between the
parietal and temporal bones, is broader than that of the
Chinook, its vertex being remarkably flat.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Swollen and
deformed legs are common from constantly doubling them
under the body while sitting in the canoe. The teeth are
frequently worn down to the gums by eating sanded
salmon.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HAIDAH DRESS AND ORNAMENT.</p>

<p>The Haidahs have no methods of distortion peculiar
to themselves, by which they seek to improve their fine
physique; but the custom of flattening the head in infancy
obtains in some of the southern nations of this
family, as the Hailtzas and Bellacoolas,<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and the Thlinkeet
lip-piece, already sufficiently described, is in use
throughout a larger part of the whole territory. It was
observed by Simpson as far south as Millbank Sound,
where it was highly useful as well as ornamental, affording
a firm hold for the fair fingers of the sex in their
drunken fights. These ornaments, made of either wood,
bone, or metal, are worn particularly large in Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Charlotte Islands, where they seem to be not a mark of
rank, but to be worn in common by all the women.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Besides
the regular lip-piece, ornaments, various in shape
and material, of shell, bone, wood, or metal, are worn
stuck in the lips, nose, and ears, apparently according to
the caprice or taste of the wearer, the skin being sometimes,
though more rarely, tattooed to correspond.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Both
for ornament and as a protection against the weather, the
skin is covered with a thick coat of paint, a black polish
being a full dress uniform. Figures of birds and beasts,
and a coat of grease are added in preparation for a feast,
with fine down of duck or goose&mdash;a stylish coat of tar and
feathers&mdash;sprinkled over the body as an extra attraction.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
When the severity of the weather makes additional protection
desirable, a blanket, formerly woven by themselves
from dog's hair, and stained in varied colors, but
now mostly procured from Europeans, is thrown loosely
over the shoulders. Chiefs, especially in times of feasting,
wear richer robes of skins.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The styles of dress and ornament
adopted around the forts from contact with the whites
need not be described. Among the more unusual articles
that have been noticed by travelers are, "a large hat,
resembling the top of a small parasol, made of the twisted
fibres of the roots of trees, with an aperture in the inside,
at the broader end" for the head, worn by a Sebassa
chief; and at Millbank Sound, "masks set with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
seals' whiskers and feathers, which expand like a fan,"
with secret springs to open the mouth and eyes.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Mackenzie
and Vancouver, who were among the earliest visitors
to this region, found fringed robes of bark-fibre,
ornamented with fur and colored threads. A circular
mat, with an opening in the centre for the head, was
worn as a protection from the rain; and war garments
consisted of several thicknesses of the strongest hides
procurable, sometimes strengthened by strips of wood on
the inside.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HAIDAH HOUSES.</p>

<p>The Haidahs use as temporary dwellings, in their frequent
summer excursions for war and the hunt, simple
lodges of poles, covered, among the poorer classes by cedar
mats, and among the rich by skins. Their permanent
villages are usually built in strong natural positions,
guarded by precipices, sometimes on rocks detached
from the main land, but connected with it by a narrow
platform. Their town houses are built of light logs, or
of thick split planks, usually of sufficient size to accommodate
a large number of families. Poole mentions a
house on Queen Charlotte Islands, which formed a cube of
fifty feet, ten feet of its height being dug in the ground, and
which accommodated seven hundred Indians. The buildings
are often, however, raised above the ground on a
platform supported by posts, sometimes carved into human
or other figures. Some of these raised buildings
seen by the earlier visitors were twenty-five or thirty
feet from the ground, solidly and neatly constructed, an
inclined log with notches serving as a ladder. These
houses were found only in the southern part of the Haidah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
territory. The fronts were generally painted with
figures of men and animals. There were no windows or
chimney; the floors were spread with cedar mats, on which
the occupants slept in a circle round a central fire, whose
smoke in its exit took its choice between the hole which
served as a door and the wall-cracks. On the south-eastern
boundary of this territory, Mackenzie found in
the villages large buildings of similar but more careful
construction, and with more elaborately carved posts, but
they were not dwellings, being used probably for religious
purposes.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE HAIDAHS.</p>

<p>Although game is plentiful, the Haidahs are not a race
of hunters, but derive their food chiefly from the innumerable
multitude of fish and sea animals, which, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
variety in its season, fill the coast waters. Most of the
coast tribes, and all who live inland, kill the deer and
other animals, particularly since the introduction of firearms,
but it is generally the skin and not the flesh that
is sought. Some tribes about the Bentinck channels, at
the time of Mackenzie's visit, would not taste flesh except
from the sea, from superstitious motives. Birds that
burrow in the sand-banks are enticed out by the glare
of torches, and knocked down in large numbers with
clubs. They are roasted without plucking or cleaning,
the entrails being left in to improve the flavor. Potatoes,
and small quantities of carrots and other vegetables, are
now cultivated throughout this territory, the crop being
repeated until the soil is exhausted, when a new place is
cleared. Wild parsnips are abundant on the banks of
lakes and streams, and their tender tops, roasted, furnish
a palatable food; berries and bulbs abound, and
the inner tegument of some varieties of the pine and
hemlock is dried in cakes and eaten with salmon-oil.
The varieties of fish sent by nature to the deep inlets
and streams for the Haidah's food, are very numerous;
their standard reliance for regular supplies being the salmon,
herring, eulachon or candle-fish, round-fish, and
halibut. Salmon are speared; dipped up in scoop-nets;
entangled in drag-nets managed between two canoes and
forced by poles to the bottom; intercepted in their pursuit
of smaller fish by gill-nets with coarse meshes, made
of cords of native hemp, stretched across the entrance of
the smaller inlets; and are caught in large wicker baskets,
placed at openings in weirs and embankments which
are built across the rivers. The salmon fishery differs
little in different parts of the Northwest. The candle-fish,
so fat that in frying they melt almost completely
into oil, and need only the insertion of a pith or bark
wick to furnish an excellent lamp, are impaled on the
sharp teeth of a rake, or comb. The handle of the rake
is from six to eight feet long, and it is swept through
the water by the Haidahs in their canoes by moonlight.
Herring in immense numbers are taken in April
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
by similar rakes, as well as by dip-nets, a large part
of the whole take being used for oil. Seals are speared
in the water or shot while on the rocks, and their flesh
is esteemed a great delicacy. Clams, cockles, and shell-fish
are captured by squaws, such an employment being
beneath manly dignity. Fish, when caught, are
delivered to the women, whose duty it is to prepare
them for winter use by drying. No salt is used, but the
fish are dried in the sun, or smoke-dried by being hung
from the top of dwellings, then wrapped in bark, or
packed in rude baskets or chests, and stowed on high
scaffolds out of the reach of dogs and children. Salmon
are opened, and the entrails, head, and back-bone removed
before drying. During the process of drying, sand is
blown over the fish, and the teeth of the eater are often
worn down by it nearly even with the gums. The spawn
of salmon and herring is greatly esteemed, and besides
that obtained from the fish caught, much is collected on
pine boughs, which are stuck in the mud until loaded
with the eggs. This native caviare is dried for preservation,
and is eaten prepared in various ways; pounded
between two stones, and beaten with water into a creamy
consistency; or boiled with sorrel and different berries,
and moulded into cakes about twelve inches square and
one inch thick by means of wooden frames. After a
sufficient supply of solid food for the winter is secured,
oil, the great heat-producing element of all northern
tribes, is extracted from the additional catch, by boiling
the fish in wooden vessels, and skimming the grease from
the water or squeezing it from the refuse. The arms and
breast of the women are the natural press in which the
mass, wrapped in mats, is hugged; the hollow stalks of an
abundant sea-weed furnish natural bottles in which the
oil is preserved for use as a sauce, and into which nearly
everything is dipped before eating. When the stock of
food is secured, it is rarely infringed upon until the
winter sets in, but then such is the Indian appetite&mdash;ten
pounds of flour in the pancake-form at a meal being
nothing for the stomach of a Haidah, according to Poole&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
whole tribes frequently suffer from hunger before
spring.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The Haidah weapons are spears from four to sixteen
feet long, some with a movable head or barb, which comes
off when the seal or whale is struck; bows and arrows;
hatchets of bone, horn, or iron, with which their planks
are made; and daggers. Both spears and arrows are frequently
pointed with iron, which, whether it found its
way across the continent from the Hudson-Bay settlements,
down the coast from the Russians, or was obtained
from wrecked vessels, was certainly used in British
Columbia for various purposes before the coming of
the whites. Bows are made of cedar, with sinew glued
along one side. Poole states that before the introduction
of fire-arms, the Queen Charlotte Islanders had no
weapon but a club. Brave as the Haidah warrior is
admitted to be, open fair fight is unknown to him, and
in true Indian style he resorts to night attacks, superior
numbers, and treachery, to defeat his foe. Cutting
off the head as a trophy is practiced instead of
scalping, but though unmercifully cruel to all sexes and
ages in the heat of battle, prolonged torture of captives
seems to be unknown. Treaties of peace are arranged
by delegations from the hostile tribes, following set forms,
and the ceremonies terminate with a many days' feast.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
Nets are made of native wild hemp and of cedar-bark
fibre; hooks, of two pieces of wood or bone fastened together
at an obtuse angle; boxes, troughs, and household
dishes, of wood; ladles and spoons, of wood, horn, and
bone. Candle-fish, with a wick of bark or pith, serve as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
lamps; drinking vessels and pipes are carved with great
skill from stone. The Haidahs are noted for their skill
in the construction of their various implements, particularly
for sculptures in stone and ivory, in which they
excel all the other tribes of Northern America.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HAIDAH MANUFACTURES.</p>

<p>The cedar-fibre and wild hemp were prepared for use
by the women by beating on the rocks; they were then
spun with a rude distaff and spindle, and woven on a
frame into the material for blankets, robes, and mats,
or twisted by the men into strong and even cord, between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the hand and thigh. Strips of otter-skin, bird-feathers,
and other materials, were also woven into the
blankets. Dogs of a peculiar breed, now nearly extinct,
were shorn each year, furnishing a long white hair, which,
mixed with fine hemp and cedar, made the best cloth.
By dyeing the materials, regular colored patterns were
produced, each tribe having had, it is said, a peculiar
pattern by which its matting could be distinguished.
Since the coming of Europeans, blankets of native manufacture
have almost entirely disappeared. The Bellacoolas
made very neat baskets, called <i>zeilusqua</i>, as well
as hats and water-tight vessels, all of fine cedar-roots.
Each chief about Fort Simpson kept an artisan, whose
business it was to repair canoes, make masks, etc.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>The Haidah canoes are dug out of cedar logs, and
are sometimes sixty feet long, six and a half wide,
and four and a half deep, accommodating one hundred
men. The prow and stern are raised, and often gracefully
curved like a swan's neck, with a monster's head
at the extremity. Boats of the better class have their
exteriors carved and painted, with the gunwale inlaid
in some cases with otter-teeth. Each canoe is made of
a single log, except the raised extremities of the larger
boats. They are impelled rapidly and safely over the
often rough waters of the coast inlets, by shovel-shaped
paddles, and when on shore, are piled up and covered
with mats for protection against the rays of the sun.
Since the coming of Europeans, sails have been added
to the native boats, and other foreign features imitated.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRADE AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Rank and power depend greatly upon wealth, which
consists of implements, wives, and slaves. Admission
to alliance with medicine-men, whose influence is greatest
in the tribe, can only be gained by sacrifice of private
property. Before the disappearance of sea-otters from
the Haidah waters, the skins of that animal formed the
chief element of their trade and wealth; now the potatoes
cultivated in some parts, and the various manufactures
of Queen Charlotte Islands, supply their slight
necessities. There is great rivalry among the islanders
in supplying the tribes on the main with potatoes, fleets
of forty or fifty canoes engaging each year in the trade
from Queen Charlotte Islands. Fort Simpson is the great
commercial rendezvous of the surrounding nations, who
assemble from all directions in September, to hold a fair,
dispose of their goods, visit friends, fight enemies, feast,
and dance. Thus continue trade and merry-making for
several weeks. Large fleets of canoes from the north also
visit Victoria each spring for trading purposes.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Very little can be said of the government of the Haidahs
in distinction from that of the other nations of the
Northwest Coast. Among nearly all of them rank is nominally
hereditary, for the most part by the female line,
but really depends to a great extent on wealth and ability
in war. Females often possess the right of chieftainship.
In early intercourse with whites the chief traded for the
whole tribe, subject, however, to the approval of the several
families, each of which seemed to form a kind of subordinate
government by itself. In some parts the power of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
chief seems absolute, and is wantonly exercised in the
commission of the most cruel acts according to his pleasure.
The extensive embankments and weirs found by
Mackenzie, although their construction must have required
the association of all the labor of the tribe, were
completely under the chief's control, and no one could
fish without his permission. The people seemed all equal,
but strangers must obey the natives or leave the village.
Crimes have no punishment by law; murder is settled for
with relatives of the victim, by death or by the payment of
a large sum; and sometimes general or notorious offenders,
especially medicine-men, are put to death by an agreement
among leading men.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Slavery is universal, and as
the life of the slave is of no value to the owner except as
property, they are treated with extreme cruelty. Slaves
the northern tribes purchase, kidnap, or capture in war
from their southern neighbors, who obtain them by like
means from each other, the course of the slave traffic being
generally from south to north, and from the coast inland.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Polygamy is everywhere practiced, and the number of
wives is regulated only by wealth, girls being bought of
parents at any price which may be agreed upon, and
returned, and the price recovered, when after a proper
trial they are not satisfactory. The transfer of the
presents or price to the bride's parents is among some
tribes accompanied by slight ceremonies nowhere fully
described. The marriage ceremonies at Millbank Sound
are performed on a platform over the water, supported
by canoes. While jealousy is not entirely unknown,
chastity appears to be so, as women who can earn the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
greatest number of blankets win great admiration for
themselves and high position for their husbands. Abortion
and infanticide are not uncommon. Twin births
are unusual, and the number of children is not large, although
the age of bearing extends to forty or forty-six
years. Women, except in the season of preparing the
winter supply of fish, are occupied in household affairs
and the care of children, for whom they are not without
some affection, and whom they nurse often to the age of
two or three years. Many families live together in one
house, with droves of filthy dogs and children, all sleeping
on mats round a central fire.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HAIDAH GAMBLERS.</p>

<p>The Haidahs, like all Indians, are inveterate gamblers,
the favorite game on Queen Charlotte Islands being odd
and even, played with small round sticks, in which the
game is won when one player has all the bunch of forty
or fifty sticks originally belonging to his opponent. Farther
south, and inland, some of the sticks are painted
with red rings, and the player's skill or luck consists
in naming the number and marks of sticks previously
wrapped by his antagonist in grass. All have become
fond of whisky since the coming of whites, but seem to
have had no intoxicating drink before. At their annual
trading fairs, and on other occasions, they are fond of
visiting and entertaining friends with ceremonious interchange
of presents, a suitable return being expected for
each gift. At these reception feasts, men and women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
are seated on benches along opposite walls; at wedding
feasts both sexes dance and sing together. In dancing,
the body, head, and arms are thrown into various attitudes
to keep time with the music, very little use being
made of the legs. On Queen Charlotte Islands the women
dance at feasts, while the men in a circle beat time
with sticks, the only instruments, except a kind of tambourine.
For their dances they deck themselves in their
best array, including plenty of birds' down, which they
delight to communicate to their partners in bowing, and
which they also blow into the air at regular intervals,
through a painted tube. Their songs are a simple and
monotonous chant, with which they accompany most of
their dances and ceremonies, though Mackenzie heard
among them some soft, plaintive tones, not unlike church
music. The chiefs in winter give a partly theatrical,
partly religious entertainment, in which, after preparation
behind a curtain, dressed in rich apparel and wearing
masks, they appear on a stage and imitate different
spirits for the instruction of the hearers, who meanwhile
keep up their songs.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>After the salmon season, feasting and conjuring are
in order. The chief, whose greatest authority is in his
character of conjurer, or <i>tzeetzaiak</i> as he is termed in
the Hailtzuk tongue, pretends at this time to live alone
in the forest, fasting or eating grass, and while there is
known as <i>taamish</i>. When he returns, clad in bear-robe,
chaplet, and red-bark collar, the crowd flies at his approach,
except a few brave spirits, who boldly present
their naked arms, from which he bites and swallows
large mouthfuls. This, skillfully done, adds to the reputation
of both biter and bitten, and is perhaps all the
foundation that exists for the report that these people are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
cannibals; although Mr Duncan, speaking of the Chimsyans
in a locality not definitely fixed, testifies to the
tearing to pieces and actual devouring of the body of a
murdered slave by naked bands of cannibal medicine-men.
Only certain parties of the initiated practice this
barbarism, others confining their tearing ceremony to
the bodies of dogs.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MAGICIANS AND MEDICINE-MEN.</p>

<p>None of these horrible orgies are practiced by the
Queen Charlotte Islanders. The performances of the
Haidah magicians, so far as they may differ from those of
the Nootkas have not been clearly described by travelers.
The magicians of Chatham Sound keep infernal spirits
shut up in a box away from the vulgar gaze, and possess
great power by reason of the implicit belief on the
part of the people, in their ability to charm away life.
The doctor, however, is not beyond the reach of a kinsman's
revenge, and is sometimes murdered.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> With their
ceremonies and superstitions there seems to be mixed
very little religion, as all their many fears have reference
to the present life. Certain owls and squirrels are
regarded with reverence, and used as charms; salmon
must not be cut across the grain, or the living fish will
leave the river; the mysterious operations with astronomical
and other European instruments about their rivers
caused great fear that the fisheries would be ruined; fogs
are conjured away without the slightest suspicion of the
sun's agency.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> European navigators they welcome by
paddling their boats several times round the ship, making
long speeches, scattering birds' down, and singing.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Ordinary presents, like tobacco or trinkets, are gladly received,
but a written testimonial is most highly prized by
the Haidahs, who regard writing as a great and valuable
mystery. They have absolutely no methods of recording
events. Although living so constantly on the water, I
find no mention of their skill in swimming, while Poole
states expressly that they have no knowledge of that
art.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Very slight accounts are extant of the peculiar methods
of curing diseases practiced by the Haidahs. Their chief
reliance, as in the case of all Indian tribes, is on the incantations
and conjurings of their sorcerers, who claim
supernatural powers of seeing, hearing, and extracting
disease, and are paid liberally when successful. Bark,
herbs, and various decoctions are used in slight sickness,
but in serious cases little reliance is placed on them. To
the bites of the sorcerer-chiefs on the main, eagle-down
is applied to stop the bleeding, after which a pine-gum
plaster or sallal-bark is applied. On Queen Charlotte
Islands, in a case of internal uneasiness, large quantities
of sea-water are swallowed, shaken up, and ejected through
the mouth for the purpose, as the natives say, of 'washing
themselves inside out.'<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HAIDAH BURIALS.</p>

<p>Death is ascribed to the ill will and malign influence
of an enemy, and one suspected of causing the death of
a prominent individual, must make ready to die. As
a rule, the bodies of the dead are burned, though exceptions
are noted in nearly every part of the territory.
In the disposal of the ashes and larger bones which
remain unburned, there seems to be no fixed usage.
Encased in boxes, baskets, or canoes, or wrapped in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
mats or bark, they are buried in or deposited on the
ground, placed in a tree, on a platform, or hung from a
pole. Articles of property are frequently deposited with
the ashes, but not uniformly. Slaves' bodies are simply
thrown into the river or the sea. Mourning for the dead
consists usually of cutting the hair and blackening anew
the face and neck for several months. Among the Kaiganies,
guests at the burning of the bodies are wont to
lacerate themselves with knives and stones. A tribe
visited by Mackenzie, kept their graves free from shrubbery,
a woman clearing that of her husband each time
she passed. The Nass Indians paddle a dead chief, gaily
dressed, round the coast villages.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>The Haidahs, compared with other North American
Indians, may be called an intelligent, honest, and brave
race, although not slow under European treatment to become
drunkards, gamblers, and thieves. Acts of unprovoked
cruelty or treachery are rare; missionaries have
been somewhat successful in the vicinity of Fort Simpson,
finding in intoxicating liquors their chief obstacle.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE NOOTKAS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Nootkas</span>, the second division of the Columbian
group, are immediately south of the Haidah country;
occupying Vancouver Island, and the coast of the main
land, between the fifty-second and the forty-ninth parallels.
The word <i>nootka</i> is not found in any native dialect
of the present day. Captain Cook, to whom we are indebted
for the term, probably misunderstood the name
given by the natives to the region of Nootka Sound.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
The first European settlement in this region was on the
Sound, which thus became the central point of early English
and Spanish intercourse with the Northwest Coast;
but it was soon abandoned, and no mission or trading
post has since taken its place, so that no tribes of this
family have been less known in later times than those
on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The chief tribes
of the Nootka family, or those on whose tribal existence,
if not on the orthography of their names authors to some
extent agree, are as follows.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The <i>Nitinats</i>, <i>Clayoquots</i>,
and <i>Nootkas</i>, on the sounds of the same names along the
west coast of Vancouver Island; the <i>Quackolls</i> and <i>Newittees</i>,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
in the north; the <i>Cowichins</i>, <i>Ucletas</i>, and <i>Comux</i>,
on the east coast of Vancouver and on the opposite main;
the <i>Saukaulutuchs</i><a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>, in the interior of the island; the <i>Clallums</i>,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
<i>Sokes</i>, and <i>Patcheena</i>, on the south end; and the
<i>Kwantlums</i> and <i>Teets</i>,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> on the lower Fraser River. These
tribes differ but little in physical peculiarities, or manners
and customs, but by their numerous dialects they have
been classed in nations. No comprehensive or satisfactory
names have, however, been applied to them as national
divisions.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>Between the Nootka family and its fish-eating neighbors
on the north and south, the line of distinction is
not clearly marked, but the contrast is greater with the
interior hunting tribes on the east. Since their first intercourse
with whites, the Nootkas have constantly decreased
in numbers, and this not only in those parts
where they have been brought into contact with traders
and miners, but on the west coast, where they have retained
in a measure their primitive state. The savage
fades before the superior race, and immediate intercourse
is not necessary to produce in native races those 'baleful
influences of civilization,' which like a pestilence are
wafted from afar, as on the wings of the wind.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA PHYSIQUE.</p>

<p>The Nootkas are of less than medium height, smaller
than the Haidahs, but rather strongly built; usually
plump, but rarely corpulent;<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> their legs, like those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
all the coast tribes, short, small, and frequently deformed,
with large feet and ankles;<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> the face broad, round, and
full, with the usual prominent cheek-bone, a low forehead,
flat nose, wide nostrils, small black eyes, round
thickish-lipped mouth, tolerably even well-set teeth; the
whole forming a countenance rather dull and expressionless,
but frequently pleasant.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The Nootka complexion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
so far as grease and paint have allowed travelers to observe
it, is decidedly light, but apparently a shade darker
than that of the Haidah family.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The hair, worn long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
is as a rule black or dark brown, coarse, and straight,
though instances are not wanting where all these qualities
are reversed.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The beard is carefully plucked out
by the young men, and this operation, repeated for generations,
has rendered the beard naturally thin. Old
men often allow it to grow on the chin and upper lip.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA HAIR AND BEARD.</p>

<p>To cut the hair short is to the Nootka a disgrace.
Worn at full length, evened at the ends, and sometimes
cut straight across the forehead, it is either allowed to
hang loosely from under a band of cloth or fillet of bark,
or is tied in a knot on the crown. On full-dress occasions
the top-knot is secured with a green bough, and
after being well saturated with whale-grease, the hair is
powdered plentifully with white feathers, which are regarded
as the crowning ornament for manly dignity in all
these regions. Both sexes, but particularly the women,
take great pains with the hair, carefully combing and
plaiting their long tresses, fashioning tasteful head-dresses
of bark-fibre, decked with beads and shells, attaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
leaden weights to the braids to keep them straight. The
bruised root of a certain plant is thought by the Ahts to
promote the growth of the hair.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The custom of flattening the head is practiced by the
Nootkas, in common with the Sound and Chinook families,
but is not universal, nor is so much importance attached
to it as elsewhere; although all seem to admire a
flattened forehead as a sign of noble birth, even among
tribes that do not make this deformity a sign of freedom.
Among the Quatsinos and Quackolls of the north, the
head, besides being flattened, is elongated into a conical
sugar-loaf shape, pointed at the top. The flattening process
begins immediately after birth, and is continued
until the child can walk. It is effected by compressing
the head with tight bandages, usually attached to the
log cradle, the forehead being first fitted with a soft pad,
a fold of soft bark, a mould of hard wood, or a flat stone.
Observers generally agree that little or no harm is done
to the brain by this infliction, the traces of which to a
great extent disappear later in life. Many tribes, including
the Aht nations, are said to have abandoned the
custom since they have been brought into contact with
the whites.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA FACE-PAINTING.</p>

<p>The body is kept constantly anointed with a reddish
clayey earth, mixed in train oil, and consequently little
affected by their frequent baths. In war and mourning
the whole body is blackened; on feast days the head,
limbs, and body are painted in fantastic figures with various
colors, apparently according to individual fancy,
although the chiefs monopolize the fancy figures, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
common people being restricted to plain colors. Solid
grease is sometimes applied in a thick coating, and carved
or moulded in <i>alto-rilievo</i> into ridges and figures afterwards
decorated with red paint, while shining sand or
grains of mica are sprinkled over grease and paint to
impart a glittering appearance. The women are either
less fond of paint than the men, or else are debarred by
their lords from the free use of it; among the Ahts, at
least of late, the women abandon ornamental paint after
the age of twenty-five. In their dances, as in war,
masks carved from cedar to represent an endless variety
of monstrous faces, painted in bright colors, with mouth
and eyes movable by strings, are attached to their heads,
giving them a grotesquely ferocious aspect.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The nose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and ears are regularly pierced in childhood, with from one
to as many holes as the feature will hold, and from the
punctures are suspended bones, shells, rings, beads, or in
fact any ornament obtainable. The lip is sometimes,
though more rarely, punctured. Bracelets and anklets
of any available material are also commonly worn.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The aboriginal dress of the Nootkas is a square blanket,
of a coarse yellow material resembling straw matting,
made by the women from cypress bark, with a mixture of
dog's hair. This blanket had usually a border of fur; it
sometimes had arm-holes, but was ordinarily thrown over
the shoulders, and confined at the waist by a belt. Chiefs
wore it painted in variegated colors or unpainted, but
the common people wore a coarser material painted uniformly
red. Women wore the garment longer and fastened
under the chin, binding an additional strip of cloth
closely about the middle, and showing much modesty
about disclosing the person, while the men often went
entirely naked. Besides the blanket, garments of many
kinds of skin were in use, particularly by the chiefs on
public days. In war, a heavy skin dress was worn as a
protection against arrows. The Nootkas usually went
bareheaded, but sometimes wore a conical hat plaited of
rushes, bark, or flax. European blankets have replaced
those of native manufacture, and many Indians about
the settlements have adopted also the shirt and breeches.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS OF THE NOOTKAS.</p>

<p>The Nootkas choose strong positions for their towns and
encampments. At Desolation Sound, Vancouver found a
village built on a detached rock with perpendicular sides,
only accessible by planks resting on the branches of a
tree, and protected on the sea side by a projecting platform
resting on timbers fixed in the crevices of the
precipice. The Nimkish tribe, according to Lord, build
their homes on a table-land overhanging the sea, and
reached by ascending a vertical cliff on a bark-rope ladder.
Each tribe has several villages in favorable locations
for fishing at different seasons. The houses, when
more than one is needed for a tribe, are placed with
regularity along streets; they vary in size according to
the need or wealth of the occupants, and are held in
common under the direction of the chief. They are constructed
in the manner following. A row of large posts,
from ten to fifteen feet high, often grotesquely carved,
supports an immense ridge-pole, sometimes two and a
half feet thick and one hundred feet long. Similar but
smaller beams, on shorter posts, are placed on either side
of the central row, distant from it fifteen, twenty, or
twenty-five feet, according to the dimensions required.
This frame is then covered with split cedar planks, about
two inches thick, and from three to eight feet wide. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
side planks are tied together with bark, and supported
by slender posts in couples just far enough apart to receive
the thickness of the plank. A house like this,
forty by one hundred feet, accommodates many families,
each of which has its allotted space, sometimes partitioned
off like a double row of stalls, with a wide passage
in the middle. In the centre of each stall is a circle of
stones for a fire-place, and round the walls are raised
couches covered with mats. In rainy weather, cracks in
the roof and sides are covered with mats. No smoke or
window holes are left, and when smoke becomes troublesome
a roof-plank is removed. The entrance is at one end.
These dwellings furnish, according to Nootka ideas, a
comfortable shelter, except when a high wind threatens
to unroof them, and then the occupants go out and sit
on the roof to keep it in place. Frequently the outside
is painted in grotesque figures of various colors. Only
the frame is permanent; matting, planks, and all utensils
are several times each year packed up and conveyed in
canoes to another locality where a frame belonging to
the tribe awaits covering. The odor arising from fish-entrails
and other filth, which they take no pains to remove,
appears to be inoffensive, but the Nootkas are often
driven by mosquitos to sleep on a stage over the water.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE NOOTKAS.</p>

<p>The Nootkas, like the Haidahs, live almost wholly on
the products of the sea, and are naturally expert fishermen.
Salmon, the great staple, are taken in August and
September, from sea, inlet, and river, by nets, spears,
pots or baskets, and even by hooks. Hooks consist of
sharp barbed bones bound to straight pieces of hard
wood; sea-wrack, maple-bark, and whale-sinew furnish
lines, which in salmon-fishing are short and attached to
the paddles. The salmon-spear is a forked pole, some
fifteen feet long, the detachable head having prongs
pointed with fish-bone or iron, and the fish in deep
water is sometimes attracted within its reach by a wooden
decoy, forced down by a long pole, and then detached
and allowed to ascend rapidly to the surface. Spearing
is carried on mostly by torch-light. A light-colored
stone pavement is sometimes laid upon the bottom of
the stream, which renders the fish visible in their passage
over it. Nets are made of nettles or of wild flax,
found along Fraser River. They are small in size, and
used as dip-nets, or sunk between two canoes and lifted
as the fish pass over. A pot or basket fifteen to twenty
feet long, three to five feet in diameter at one end,
and tapering to a point at the other, is made of pine
splinters one or two inches apart, with twig-hoops; and
placed, large end up stream, at the foot of a fall or at
an opening in an embankment. The salmon are driven
down the fall with poles, and entering the basket are
taken out by a door in the small end. This basket is
sometimes enclosed in another one, similar but of uniform
diameter, and closed at one end. Fences of stakes
across the river oblige the salmon to enter the open
mouth in their passage up, and passing readily through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
an opening left in the point of the inner basket, they
find themselves entrapped. In March, herring appear on
the coast in great numbers, and in April and May they
enter the inlets and streams, where they are taken with
a dip-net, or more commonly by the fish-rake&mdash;a pole
armed with many sharp bones or nails. Early in the
season they can be taken only by torch-light. Halibut
abound from March to June, and are caught with hooks
and long lines, generally at some distance from shore.
For all other fish, European hooks were early adopted,
but the halibut, at least among the Ahts, must still be
taken with the native hook. Many other varieties of
fish, caught by similar methods, are used as food, but
those named supply the bulk of the Nootka's provision.
In May or June, whales appear and are attacked in
canoes by the chief, with the select few from each tribe
who alone have the right to hunt this monarch of the
sea. The head of their harpoon is made of two barbed
bones and pointed with muscle-shell; it is fastened to a
whale-sinew line of a few feet in length, and this short
line to a very long bark rope, at one end of which are
seal-skin air-bags and bladders, to keep it afloat. The
point is also fastened to a shaft from ten to twenty-five
feet in length, from which it is easily detached. With
many of these buoys in tow the whale cannot dive, and
becomes an easy prey. Whale-blubber and oil are great
delicacies, the former being preferred half putrid, while
the oil with that of smaller denizens of the sea preserved
in bladders, is esteemed a delicious sauce, and eaten with
almost everything. Sea-otters and seals are also speared,
the former with a weapon more barbed and firmly attached
to the handle, as they are fierce fighters; but when
found asleep on the rocks, they are shot with arrows.
Seals are often attracted within arrow-shot by natives
disguised as seals in wooden masks.</p>

<p>Clams and other shell-fish, which are collected in great
numbers by the women, are cooked, strung on cypress-bark
cords, and hung in the houses to dry for winter
use. Fish are preserved by drying only, the use of salt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
being unknown. Salmon, after losing their heads and
tails, which are eaten in the fishing season, are split open
and the back-bone taken out before drying; smaller fry
are sometimes dried as they come from their element;
but halibut and cod are cut up and receive a partial drying
in the sun. The spawn of all fish, but particularly
of salmon and herring, is carefully preserved by stowing
it away in baskets, where it ferments. Bear, deer, and
other land animals, as well as wild fowl, are sometimes
taken for food, by means of rude traps, nets, and covers,
successful only when game is abundant, for the Nootkas
are but indifferent hunters. In the time of Jewitt, three
peculiarities were observable in the Nootka use of animal
food, particularly bear-meat. When a bear was
killed, it was dressed in a bonnet, decked with fine down,
and solemnly invited to eat in the chief's presence, before
being eaten; after partaking of bruin's flesh, which
was appreciated as a rarity, the Nootka could not taste
fresh fish for two months; and while fish to be palatable
must be putrid, meat when tainted was no longer fit for
food. The Nootka cuisine furnished food in four styles;
namely, boiled&mdash;the mode par excellence, applicable to
every variety of food, and effected, as by the Haidahs,
by hot stones in wooden vessels; steamed&mdash;of rarer use,
applied mostly to heads, tails, and fins, by pouring water
over them on a bed of hot stones, and covering the whole
tightly with mats; roasted&mdash;rarely, in the case of some
smaller fish and clams; and raw&mdash;fish-spawn and most
other kinds of food, when conveniences for cooking were
not at hand. Some varieties of sea-weed and lichens, as
well as the camass, and other roots, were regularly laid
up for winter, while berries, everywhere abundant, were
eaten in great quantities in their season, and at least one
variety preserved by pressing in bunches. In eating,
they sit in groups of five or six, with their legs doubled
under them round a large wooden tray, and dip out the
food nearly always boiled to a brothy consistency, with
their fingers or clam-shells, paying little or no attention
to cleanliness. Chiefs and slaves have trays apart, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the principal meal, according to Cook, was about noon.
Feasting is the favorite way of entertaining friends,
so long as food is plentiful; and by a curious custom, of
the portion allotted them, guests must carry away what
they cannot eat. Water in aboriginal days was the only
Nootka drink; it is also used now when whisky is not to
be had.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA BATTLES AND BOATS.</p>

<p>Lances and arrows, pointed with shell, slate, flint,
or bone, and clubs and daggers of wood and bone, were
the weapons with which they met their foes; but firearms
and metallic daggers, and tomahawks, have long
since displaced them, as they have to a less degree the
original hunting and fishing implements.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The Nootka
tribes were always at war with each other, hereditary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
quarrels being handed down for generations. According
to their idea, loss of life in battle can be forgotten only
when an equal number of the hostile tribe are killed.
Their military tactics consist of stratagem and surprise
in attack, and watchfulness in defense. Before engaging
in war, some weeks are spent in preparation, which
consists mainly of abstinence from women, bathing, scrubbing
the skin with briers till it bleeds, and finally painting
the whole body jet-black. All prisoners not suitable
for slaves are butchered or beheaded. In an attack the
effort is always made to steal into the adversary's camp
at night and kill men enough to decide the victory before
the alarm can be given. When they fail in this,
the battle is seldom long continued, for actual hand-to-hand
fighting is not to the Nootka taste. On the rare
occasions when it is considered desirable to make overtures
of peace, an ambassador is sent with an ornamented
pipe, and with this emblem his person is safe. Smoking
a pipe together by hostile chiefs also solemnizes a treaty.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Nootka boats are dug out each from a single pine-tree,
and are made of all sizes from ten to fifty feet long, the
largest accommodating forty or fifty men. Selecting a
proper tree in the forest, the aboriginal Nootka fells it
with a sort of chisel of flint or elk-horn, three by six
inches, fastened in a wooden handle, and struck by a
smooth stone mallet. Then the log is split with wooden
wedges, and the better piece being selected, it is hollowed
out with the aforesaid chisel, a mussel-shell adze, and a
bird's-bone gimlet worked between the two hands. Sometimes,
but not always, fire is used as an assistant. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
exterior is fashioned with the same tools. The boat is
widest in the middle, tapers toward each end, and is
strengthened by light cross-pieces extending from side to
side, which, being inserted after the boat is soaked in hot
water, modify and improve the original form. The bow
is long and pointed, the stern square-cut or slightly rounded;
both ends are raised higher than the middle by separate
pieces of wood painted with figures of birds or
beasts, the head on the bow and the tail on the stern.
The inside is painted red; the outside, slightly burned,
is rubbed smooth and black, and for the whale fishery
is ornamented along the gunwales with a row of small
shells or seal-teeth, but for purposes of war it is painted
with figures in white. Paddles are neatly made of hard
wood, about five and a half feet long with a leaf-shaped
blade of two feet, sharp at the end, and used as a weapon
in canoe-fighting. A cross-piece is sometimes added to
the handle like the top of a crutch.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the implements already named are
chests and boxes, buckets, cups and eating-troughs, all
of wood, either dug out or pinned together; baskets of
twigs and bags of matting; all neatly made, and many
of the articles painted or carved, or ornamented with
shell work. As among the Haidahs, the dried <i>eulachon</i>
is often used as a lamp.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The matting and coarser kinds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of cloth are made of rushes and of pine or cedar bark,
which after being soaked is beaten on a plank with a
grooved instrument of wood or bone until the fibres are
separated. The threads are twisted into cords between
the hand and thigh; these cords, hung to a horizontal
beam and knotted with finer thread at regular intervals,
form the cloth. Thread of the same bark is used with
a sharpened twig for a needle. Intercourse with Europeans
has modified their manufactures, and checked the
development of their native ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PROPERTY OF THE NOOTKAS.</p>

<p>Captain Cook found among the Ahts very "strict notions
of their having a right to the exclusive property
of everything that their country produces," so that they
claimed pay for even wood, water, and grass. The limits
of tribal property are very clearly defined, but individuals
rarely claim any property in land. Houses belong
to the men who combine to build them. Private wealth
consists of boats and implements for obtaining food, domestic
utensils, slaves, and blankets, the latter being
generally the standard by which wealth or price is
computed. Food is not regarded as common property,
yet any man may help himself to his neighbor's store
when needy. The accumulation of property beyond the
necessities of life is considered desirable only for the
purpose of distributing it in presents on great feast-days,
and thereby acquiring a reputation for wealth and liberality;
and as these feasts occur frequently, an unsuccessful
man may often take a fresh start in the race.
Instead of being given away, canoes and blankets are
often destroyed, which proves that the motive in this
disposal of property is not to favor friends, but merely
to appear indifferent to wealth. It is certainly a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
remarkable custom, and one that exerts a great influence
on the whole people. Gifts play an important part in
procuring a wife, and a division of property accompanies
a divorce. To enter the ranks of the medicine-men or
magicians, or to attain rank of any kind, property must
be sacrificed; and a man who receives an insult or suffers
any affliction must tear up the requisite quantity of
blankets and shirts, if he would retain his honor.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Trade
in all their productions was carried on briskly between
the different Nootka tribes before the coming of the
whites. They manifest much shrewdness in their exchanges;
even their system of presents is a species of
trade, the full value of each gift being confidently expected
in a return present on the next festive occasion.
In their intertribal commerce, a band holding a strong
position where trade by canoes between different parts
may be stopped, do not fail to offer and enforce the acceptance
of their services as middlemen, thereby greatly
increasing market prices.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>The system of numeration, sufficiently extensive for
the largest numbers, is decimal, the numbers to ten
having names which are in some instances compounds
but not multiples of smaller numbers. The fingers are
used to aid in counting. The year is divided into months
with some reference to the moon, but chiefly by the fish-seasons,
ripening of berries, migrations of birds, and
other periodical events, for which the months are named,
as: 'when the herrings spawn,' etc. The unit of measure
is the span, the fingers representing its fractional
parts.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The Nootkas display considerable taste in ornamenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
with sculpture and paintings their implements
and houses, their chief efforts being made on the posts
of the latter, and the wooden masks which they wear
in war and some of their dances; but all implements
may be more or less carved and adorned according to
the artist's fancy. They sometimes paint fishing and
hunting scenes, but generally their models exist only
in imagination, and their works consequently assume
unintelligible forms. There seems to be no evidence
that their carved images and complicated paintings are
in any sense intended as idols or hieroglyphics. A rude
system of heraldry prevails among them, by which some
animal is adopted as a family crest, and its figure is
painted or embroidered on canoes, paddles, or blankets.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA ART AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>To the Nootka system of government the terms patriarchal,
hereditary, and feudal have been applied. There
is no confederation, each tribe being independent of all
the rest, except as powerful tribes are naturally dominant
over the weak. In each tribe the head chief's rank
is hereditary by the male line; his grandeur is displayed
on great occasions, when, decked in all his finery, he is
the central figure. At the frequently recurring feasts of
state he occupies the seat of honor; presides at all councils
of the tribe, and is respected and highly honored by
all; but has no real authority over any but his slaves.
Between the chief, or king, and the people is a nobility,
in number about one fourth of the whole tribe, composed
of several grades, the highest being partially hereditary,
but also, as are all the lower grades, obtainable by feats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
of valor or great liberality. All chieftains must be confirmed
by the tribe, and some of them appointed by the
king; each man's rank is clearly defined in the tribe, and
corresponding privileges strictly insisted on. There are
chiefs who have full authority in warlike expeditions.
Harpooners also form a privileged class, whose rank is
handed down from father to son. This somewhat complicated
system of government nevertheless sits lightly,
since the people are neither taxed nor subjected to any
laws, nor interfered with in their actions. Still, long-continued
custom serves as law and marks out the few
duties and privileges of the Nootka citizen. Stealing
is not common except from strangers; and offenses requiring
punishment are usually avenged&mdash;or pardoned
in consideration of certain blankets received&mdash;by the
injured parties and their friends, the chiefs seeming to
have little or nothing to do in the matter.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA SLAVERY AND MARRIAGE.</p>

<p>Slavery is practiced by all the tribes, and the slave-trade
forms an important part of their commerce. Slaves
are about the only property that must not be sacrificed
to acquire the ever-desired reputation for liberality.
Only rich men&mdash;according to some authorities only the
nobles&mdash;may hold slaves. War and kidnapping supply
the slave-market, and no captive, whatever his rank in
his own tribe, can escape this fate, except by a heavy
ransom offered soon after he is taken, and before his
whereabouts becomes unknown to his friends. Children
of slaves, whose fathers are never known, are forever
slaves. The power of the owner is arbitrary and unlimited
over the actions and life of the slave, but a cruel
exercise of his power seems of rare occurrence, and,
save the hard labor required, the material condition of
the slave is but little worse than that of the common
free people, since he is sheltered by the same roof and
partakes of the same food as his master. Socially the
slave is despised; his hair is cut short, and his very name
becomes a term of reproach. Female slaves are prostituted
for hire, especially in the vicinity of white settlements.
A runaway slave is generally seized and resold
by the first tribe he meets.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE NOOTKA FAMILY.</p>

<p>The Nootka may have as many wives as he can buy,
but as prices are high, polygamy is practically restricted
to the chiefs, who are careful not to form alliances with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
families beneath them in rank. Especially particular as
to rank are the chiefs in choosing their first wife, always
preferring the daughters of noble families of another tribe.
Courtship consists in an offer of presents by the lover to
the girl's father, accompanied generally by lengthy speeches
of friends on both sides, extolling the value of the man
and his gift, and the attractions of the bride. After the
bargain is concluded, a period of feasting follows if the
parties are rich, but this is not necessary as a part of
the marriage ceremony. Betrothals are often made by
parents while the parties are yet children, mutual deposits
of blankets and other property being made as
securities for the fulfillment of the contract, which is
rarely broken. Girls marry at an average age of sixteen.
The common Nootka obtains his one bride from his own
rank also by a present of blankets, much more humble
than that of his rich neighbor, and is assisted in his
overtures by perhaps a single friend instead of being
followed by the whole tribe. Courtship among this class
is not altogether without the attentions which render it
so charming in civilized life; as when the fond girl lovingly
caresses and searches her lover's head, always giving
him the fattest of her discoveries. Wives are not
ill treated, and although somewhat overworked, the division
of labor is not so oppressive as among many
Indian tribes. Men build houses, make boats and implements,
hunt and fish; women prepare the fish and
game for winter use, cook, manufacture cloth and clothing,
and increase the stock of food by gathering berries
and shell-fish; and most of this work among the richer
class is done by slaves. Wives are consulted in matters
of trade, and in fact seem to be nearly on terms of equality
with their husbands, except that they are excluded
from some public feasts and ceremonies. There is much
reason to suppose that before the advent of the whites, the
Nootka wife was comparatively faithful to her lord, that
chastity was regarded as a desirable female quality, and offenses
against it severely punished. The females so freely
brought on board the vessels of early voyagers and offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
to the men, were perhaps slaves, who are everywhere
prostituted for gain, so that the fathers of their children
are never known. Women rarely have more than two
or three children, and cease bearing at about twenty-five,
frequently preventing the increase of their family by
abortions. Pregnancy and childbirth affect them but
little. The male child is named at birth, but his name
is afterwards frequently changed. He is suckled by the
mother until three or four years old, and at an early
age begins to learn the arts of fishing by which he is to
live. Children are not quarrelsome among themselves,
and are regarded by both parents with some show of
affection and pride. Girls at puberty are closely confined
for several days, and given a little water but no
food; they are kept particularly from the sun or fire, to
see either of which at this period would be a lasting disgrace.
At such times feasts are given by the parents.
Divorces or separations may be had at will by either
party, but a strict division of property and return of
betrothal presents is expected, the woman being allowed
not only the property she brought her husband, and articles
manufactured by her in wedlock, but a certain proportion
of the common wealth. Such property as belongs
to the father and is not distributed in gifts during
his life, or destroyed at his death, is inherited by the
eldest son.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>From the middle of November to the middle of January,
is the Nootka season of mirth and festivity, when
nearly the whole time is occupied with public and private
gaiety. Their evenings are privately passed by the
family group within doors in conversation, singing, joking,
boasting of past exploits, personal and tribal, and
teasing the women until bed-time, when one by one they
retire to rest in the same blankets worn during the day.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
Swimming and trials of strength by hooking together
the little fingers, or scuffling for a prize, seem to be the
only out-door amusements indulged in by adults, while
the children shoot arrows and hurl spears at grass figures
of birds and fishes, and prepare themselves for future
conflicts by cutting off the heads of imaginary enemies
modeled in mud.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> To gambling the Nootkas are passionately
addicted, but their games are remarkably few
and uniform. Small bits of wood compose their entire
paraphernalia, sometimes used like dice, when the game
depends on the side turned up; or passed rapidly from
hand to hand, when the gamester attempts to name the
hand containing the trump stick; or again concealed in
dust spread over a blanket and moved about by one player
that the rest may guess its location. In playing they
always form a circle seated on the ground, and the women
rarely if ever join the game.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> They indulge in smoking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the only pipes of their own manufacture being of
plain cedar, filled now with tobacco by those who can
afford it, but in which they formerly smoked, as it is
supposed, the leaves of a native plant&mdash;still mixed with
tobacco to lessen its intoxicating properties. The pipe
is passed round after a meal, but seems to be less used
in serious ceremonies than among eastern Indian nations.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA AMUSEMENTS.</p>

<p>But the Nootka amusement par excellence is that of
feasts, given by the richer classes and chiefs nearly every
evening during 'the season.' Male and female heralds are
employed ceremoniously to invite the guests, the house having
been first cleared of its partitions, and its floor spread
with mats.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> As in countries more civilized, the common
people go early to secure the best seats, their allotted place
being near the door. The élite come later, after being
repeatedly sent for; on arrival they are announced by
name, and assigned a place according to rank. In one
corner of the hall the fish and whale-blubber are boiled
by the wives of the chiefs, who serve it to the guests in
pieces larger or smaller, according to their rank. What
can not be eaten must be carried home. Their drink ordinarily
is pure water, but occasionally berries of a peculiar
kind, preserved in cakes, are stirred in until a froth is
formed which swells the body of the drinker nearly to
bursting.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Eating is followed by conversation and speech-making,
oratory being an art highly prized, in which,
with their fine voices, they become skillful. Finally,
the floor is cleared for dancing. In the dances in which
the crowd participate, the dancers, with faces painted in
black and vermilion, form a circle round a few leaders
who give the step, which consists chiefly in jumping with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
both feet from the ground, brandishing weapons or bunches
of feathers, or sometimes simply bending the body without
moving the feet. As to the participation of women
in these dances, authorities do not agree.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In a sort of
conversational dance all pass briskly round the room to
the sound of music, praising in exclamations the building
and all within it, while another dance requires many
to climb upon the roof and there continue their motions.
Their special or character dances are many, and in them
they show much dramatic talent. A curtain is stretched
across a corner of the room to conceal the preparations,
and the actors, fantastically dressed, represent personal
combats, hunting scenes, or the actions of different animals.
In the seal-dance naked men jump into the water
and then crawl out and over the floors, imitating the
motions of the seal. Indecent performances are mentioned
by some visitors. Sometimes in these dances
men drop suddenly as if dead, and are at last revived
by the doctors, who also give dramatic or magic performances
at their houses; or they illuminate a wax moon
out on the water, and make the natives believe they are
communing with the man in the moon. To tell just
where amusement ceases and solemnity begins in these
dances is impossible.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Birds' down forms an important
item in the decoration at dances, especially at the reception
of strangers. All dances, as well as other ceremonies,
are accompanied by continual music, instrumental
and vocal. The instruments are: boxes and benches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
struck with sticks; a plank hollowed out on the under
side and beaten with drum-sticks about a foot long; a
rattle made of dried seal-skin in the form of a fish, with
pebbles; a whistle of deer-bone about an inch long with
one hole, which like the rattle can only be used by chiefs;
and a bunch of muscle-shells, to be shaken like castanets.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
Their songs are monotonous chants, extending over but
few notes, varied by occasional howls and whoops in some
of the more spirited melodies, pleasant or otherwise, according
to the taste of the hearer.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Certain of their
feasts are given periodically by the head chiefs, which
distant tribes attend, and during which take place the
distributions of property already mentioned. Whenever
a gift is offered, etiquette requires the recipient to snatch
it rudely from the donor with a stern and surly look.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>Among the miscellaneous customs noticed by the different
authorities already quoted, may be mentioned the following.
Daily bathing in the sea is practiced, the vapor-bath
not being used. Children are rolled in the snow by
their mothers to make them hardy. Camps and other
property are moved from place to place by piling them on
a plank platform built across the canoes. Whymper saw
Indians near Bute Inlet carrying burdens on the back by
a strap across the forehead. In a fight they rarely strike
but close and depend on pulling hair and scratching; a
chance blow must be made up by a present. Invitations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
to eat must not be declined, no matter how often repeated.
Out of doors there is no native gesture of salutation, but
in the houses a guest is motioned politely to a couch;
guests are held sacred, and great ceremonies are performed
at the reception of strangers; all important events
are announced by heralds. Friends sometimes saunter
along hand in hand. A secret society, independent of
tribe, family, or crest, is supposed by Sproat to exist among
them, but its purposes are unknown. In a palaver
with whites the orator holds a long white pole in his
hand, which he sticks occasionally into the ground by
way of emphasis. An animal chosen as a crest must
not be shot or ill-treated in the presence of any wearing
its figure; boys recite portions of their elders' speeches
as declamations; names are changed many times during
life, at the will of the individual or of the tribe.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS AND CANNIBALISM.</p>

<p>In sorcery, witchcraft, prophecy, dreams, evil spirits,
and the transmigration of souls, the Nootkas are firm
believers, and these beliefs enable the numerous sorcerers
of different grades to acquire great power in the
tribes by their strange ridiculous ceremonies. Most of
their tricks are transparent, being deceptions worked by
the aid of confederates to keep up their power; but, as
in all religions, the votary must have some faith in the
efficacy of their incantations. The sorcerer, before giving
a special demonstration, retires apart to meditate.
After spending some time alone in the forests and mountains,
fasting and lacerating the flesh, he appears suddenly
before the tribe, emaciated, wild with excitement,
clad in a strange costume, grotesquely painted, and
wearing a hideous mask. The scenes that ensue are
indescribable, but the aim seems to be to commit all the
wild freaks that a maniac's imagination may devise,
accompanied by the most unearthly yells which can terrorize
the heart. Live dogs and dead human bodies are
seized and torn by their teeth; but, at least in later times,
they seem not to attack the living, and their performances
are somewhat less horrible and bloody than the
wild orgies of the northern tribes. The sorcerer is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
thought to have more influence with bad spirits than
with good, and is always resorted to in the case of any
serious misfortune. New members of the fraternity are
initiated into the mysteries by similar ceremonies. Old
women are not without their traditional mysterious powers
in matters of prophecy and witchcraft; and all chiefs
in times of perplexity practice fasting and laceration.
Dreams are believed to be the visits of spirits or of the
wandering soul of some living party, and the unfortunate
Nootka boy or girl whose blubber-loaded stomach
causes uneasy dreams, must be properly hacked, scorched,
smothered, and otherwise tormented until the evil spirit
is appeased.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Whether or not these people were cannibals,
is a disputed question, but there seems to be little
doubt that slaves have been sacrificed and eaten as a
part of their devilish rites.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>The Nootkas are generally a long-lived race, and from
the beginning to the failing of manhood undergo little
change in appearance. Jewitt states that during his captivity
of three years at Nootka Sound, only five natural
deaths occurred, and the people suffered scarcely any disease
except the colic. Sproat mentions as the commonest
diseases; bilious complaints, dysentery, a consumption
which almost always follows syphilis, fevers, and among
the aged, ophthalmia. Accidental injuries, as cuts, bruises,
sprains, and broken limbs, are treated with considerable
success by means of simple salves or gums,
cold water, pine-bark bandages, and wooden splints.
Natural pains and maladies are invariably ascribed to the
absence or other irregular conduct of the soul, or to the
influence of evil spirits, and all treatment is directed to
the recall of the former and to the appeasing of the latter.
Still, so long as the ailment is slight, simple means are
resorted to, and the patient is kindly cared for by the
women; as when headache, colic, or rheumatism is
treated by the application of hot or cold water, hot ashes,
friction, or the swallowing of cold teas made from various
roots and leaves. Nearly every disease has a specific
for its cure. Oregon grape and other herbs cure syphilis;
wasp-nest powder is a tonic, and blackberries an astringent;
hemlock bark forms a plaster, and dog-wood bark
is a strengthener; an infusion of young pine cones or
the inside scrapings of a human skull prevent too rapid
family increase, while certain plants facilitate abortion.
When a sickness becomes serious, the sorcerer or medicine-man
is called in and incantations begin, more or less
noisy according to the amount of the prospective fee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
and the number of relatives and friends who join in the
uproar. A very poor wretch is permitted to die in comparative
quiet. In difficult cases the doctor, wrought up
to the highest state of excitement, claims to see and hear
the soul, and to judge of the patient's prospects by its
position and movements. The sick man shows little
fortitude, and abandons himself helplessly to the doctor's
ridiculous measures. Failing in a cure, the physician
gets no pay, but if successful, does not fail to make a
large demand. Both the old and the helplessly sick are
frequently abandoned by the Ahts to die without aid in
the forest.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA BURIAL.</p>

<p>After death the Nootka's body is promptly put away;
a slave's body is unceremoniously thrown into the water;
that of a freeman, is placed in a crouching posture,
their favorite one during life, in a deep wooden box, or
in a canoe, and suspended from the branches of a tree,
deposited on the ground with a covering of sticks and
stones, or, more rarely, buried. Common people are usually
left on the surface; the nobility are suspended from
trees at heights differing, as some authorities say, according
to rank. The practice of burning the dead seems
also to have been followed in some parts of this region.
Each tribe has a burying-ground chosen on some hill-side
or small island. With chiefs, blankets, skins, and
other property in large amounts are buried, hung up
about the grave, or burned during the funeral ceremonies,
which are not complicated except for the highest
officials. The coffins are often ornamented with carvings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
or paintings of the deceased man's crest, or with
rows of shells. When a death occurs, the women of
the tribe make a general howl, and keep it up at intervals
for many days or months; the men, after a little speech-making,
keep silent. The family and friends, with blackened
faces and hair cut short, follow the body to its last
resting-place with music and other manifestations of sorrow,
generally terminating in a feast. There is great
reluctance to explain their funeral usages to strangers;
death being regarded by this people with great superstition
and dread, not from solicitude for the welfare of
the dead, but from a belief in the power of departed
spirits to do much harm to the living.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE NOOTKAS.</p>

<p>The Nootka character presents all the inconsistencies
observable among other American aborigines, since there
is hardly a good or bad trait that has not by some observer
been ascribed to them. Their idiosyncrasies as a
race are perhaps best given by Sproat as "want of observation,
a great deficiency of foresight, extreme fickleness
in their passions and purposes, habitual suspicion,
and a love of power and display; added to which may
be noticed their ingratitude and revengeful disposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
their readiness for war, and revolting indifference to
human suffering." These qualities, judged by civilized
standards censurable, to the Nootka are praiseworthy,
while contrary qualities are to be avoided. By a strict
application, therefore, of 'put yourself in his place' principles,
to which most 'good Indians' owe their reputation,
Nootka character must not be too harshly condemned.
They are not, so far as physical actions are concerned, a
remarkably lazy people, but their minds, although intelligent
when aroused, are averse to effort and quickly
fatigued; nor can they comprehend the advantage of continued
effort for any future good which is at all remote.
What little foresight they have, has much in common
with the instinct of beasts. Ordinarily, they are quiet
and well behaved, especially the higher classes, but when
once roused to anger, they rage, bite, spit and kick without
the slightest attempt at self-possession. A serious offense
against an individual, although nominally pardoned
in consideration of presents, can really never be completely
atoned for except by blood; hence private, family,
and tribal feuds continue from generation to generation.
Women are not immodest, but the men have no shame.
Stealing is recognized as a fault, and the practice as between
members of the same tribe is rare, but skillful pilfering
from strangers, if not officially sanctioned, is extensively
carried on and much admired; still any property
confided in trust to a Nootka is said to be faithfully
returned. To his wife he is kind and just; to his children
affectionate. Efforts for their conversion to foreign
religions have been in the highest degree unsuccessful.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>

<p class="sidenote">THE SOUND INDIANS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Sound Indians</span>, by which term I find it convenient
to designate the nations about Puget Sound, constitute
the third family of the Columbian group. In this
division I include all the natives of that part of Washington
which lies to the west of the Cascade Range,
except a strip from twenty-five to forty miles wide along
the north bank of the Columbia. The north-eastern
section of this territory, including the San Juan group,
Whidbey Island, and the region tributary to Bellingham
Bay, is the home of the <i>Nooksak</i>, <i>Lummi</i>, <i>Samish</i> and
<i>Skagit</i> nations, whose neighbors and constant harassers
on the north are the fierce Kwantlums and Cowichins of
the Nootka family about the mouth of the Fraser. The
central section, comprising the shores and islands of
Admiralty Inlet, Hood Canal, and Puget Sound proper,
is occupied by numerous tribes with variously spelled
names, mostly terminating in <i>mish</i>, which names, with
all their orthographic diversity, have been given generally
to the streams on whose banks the different nations
dwelt. All these tribes may be termed the <i>Nisqually</i>
nation, taking the name from the most numerous
and best-known of the tribes located about the head of
the sound. The <i>Clallams</i> inhabit the eastern portion
of the peninsula between the sound and the Pacific.
The western extremity of the same peninsula, terminating
at Cape Flattery, is occupied by the <i>Classets</i> or <i>Makahs</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
while the <i>Chehalis</i> and <i>Cowlitz</i> nations are found on the
Chehalis River, Gray Harbor, and the upper Cowlitz.
Excepting a few bands on the headwaters of streams
that rise in the vicinity of Mount Baker, the Sound
family belongs to the coast fish-eating tribes rather than
to the hunters of the interior. Indeed, this family has
so few marked peculiarities, possessing apparently no trait
or custom not found as well among the Nootkas or Chinooks,
that it may be described in comparatively few
words. When first known to Europeans they seem to
have been far less numerous than might have been expected
from the extraordinary fertility and climatic advantages
of their country; and since they have been in
contact with the whites, their numbers have been reduced,&mdash;chiefly
through the agency of small-pox and
ague,&mdash;even more rapidly than the nations farther to the
north-west.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>These natives of Washington are short and thick-set,
with strong limbs, but bow-legged; they have broad faces,
eyes fine but wide apart; noses prominent, both of Roman
and aquiline type; color, a light copper, perhaps a
shade darker than that of the Nootkas, but capable of
transmitting a flush; the hair usually black and almost
universally worn long.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>All the tribes flatten the head more or less, but none
carry the practice to such an extent as their neighbors on
the south, unless it be the Cowlitz nation, which might
indeed as correctly be classed with the Chinooks. By
most of the Sound natives tattooing is not practiced, and
they seem somewhat less addicted to a constant use of
paint than the Nootkas; yet on festive occasions a plentiful
and hideous application is made of charcoal or colored
earth pulverized in grease, and the women appreciate the
charms imparted to the face by the use of vermilion clay.
The nose, particularly at Cape Flattery, is the grand
centre of facial ornamentation. Perforating is extravagantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
practiced, and pendant trinkets of every form and
substance are worn, those of bone or shell preferred, and,
if we may credit Wilkes, by some of the women these
ornaments are actually kept clean.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SOUND DRESS AND DWELLINGS.</p>

<p>The native garment, when the weather makes nakedness
uncomfortable, is a blanket of dog's hair, sometimes
mixed with birds' down and bark-fibre, thrown about the
shoulders. Some few fasten this about the neck with a
wooden pin. The women are more careful in covering
the person with the blanket than are the men, and generally
wear under it a bark apron hanging from the waist
in front. A cone-shaped, water-proof hat, woven from
colored grasses, is sometimes worn on the head.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Temporary hunting-huts in summer are merely cross-sticks
covered with coarse mats made by laying bulrushes
side by side, and knotting them at intervals with cord
or grass. The poorer individuals or tribes dwell permanently
in similar huts, improved by the addition of a
few slabs; while the rich and powerful build substantial
houses, of planks split from trees by means of bone
wedges, much like the Nootka dwellings in plan, and
nearly as large. These houses sometimes measure over
one hundred feet in length, and are divided into rooms or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
pens, each house accommodating many families. There
are several fire-places in each dwelling; raised benches
extend round the sides, and the walls are often lined with
matting.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE SOUND INDIANS.</p>

<p>In spring time they abandon their regular dwellings
and resort in small companies to the various sources of
food-supply. Fish is their chief dependence, though
game is taken in much larger quantities than by the
Nootkas; some of the more inland Sound tribes subsisting
almost entirely by the chase and by root-digging.
Nearly all the varieties of fish which support the northern
tribes are also abundant here, and are taken substantially
by the same methods, namely, by the net, hook,
spear, and rake; but fisheries seem to be carried on somewhat
less systematically, and I find no account of the
extensive and complicated embankments and traps mentioned
by travelers in British Columbia. To the salmon,
sturgeon, herring, rock-cod, and candle-fish, abundant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
in the inlets of the sound, the Classets, by venturing out
to sea, add a supply of whale-blubber and otter-meat,
obtained with spears, lines, and floats. At certain points
on the shore tall poles are erected, across which nets are
spread; and against these nets large numbers of wild
fowl, dazzled by torch-lights at night, dash themselves
and fall stunned to the ground, where the natives stand
ready to gather in the feathery harvest. Vancouver noticed
many of these poles in different localities, but could
not divine their use. Deer and elk in the forests are
also hunted by night, and brought within arrow-shot by
the spell of torches. For preservation, fish are dried in
the sun or dried and smoked by the domestic hearth,
and sometimes pounded fine, as are roots of various kinds;
clams are dried on strings and hung up in the houses,
or occasionally worn round the neck, ministering to the
native love of ornament until the stronger instinct of
hunger impairs the beauty of the necklace. In the better
class of houses, supplies are neatly stored in baskets
at the sides. The people are extremely improvident,
and, notwithstanding their abundant natural supplies in
ocean, stream, and forest, are often in great want. Boiling
in wooden vessels by means of hot stones is the
ordinary method of cooking. A visitor to the Nooksaks
thus describes their method of steaming elk-meat: "They
first dig a hole in the ground, then build a wood fire,
placing stones on the top of it. As it burns, the stones
become hot and fall down. Moss and leaves are then
placed on the top of the hot stones, the meat on these,
and another layer of moss and leaves laid over it. Water
is poured on, which is speedily converted into steam.
This is retained by mats carefully placed over the heap.
When left in this way for a night, the meat is found
tender and well cooked in the morning." Fowls were
cooked in the same manner by the Queniults.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>I find no mention of other weapons, offensive or defensive,
than spears, and bows and arrows. The arrows
and spears were usually pointed with bone; the bows
were of yew, and though short, were of great power.
Vancouver describes a superior bow used at Puget Sound.
It was from two and a half to three feet long, made
from a naturally curved piece of yew, whose concave
side became the convex of the bow, and to the whole
length of this side a strip of elastic hide or serpent-skin
was attached so firmly by a kind of cement as to become
almost a part of the wood. This lining added greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
to the strength of the bow, and was not affected by
moisture. The bow-string was made of sinew.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The
tribes were continually at war with each other, and with
northern nations, generally losing many of their people
in battle. Sticking the heads of the slain enemy on
poles in front of their dwellings, is a common way of
demonstrating their joy over a victory. The Indians at
Port Discovery spoke to Wilkes of scalping among their
warlike exploits, but according to Kane the Classets do
not practice that usage.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Vancouver, finding sepulchres
at Penn Cove, in which were large quantities of human
bones but no limb-bones of adults, suspected that
the latter were used by the Indians for pointing their
arrows, and in the manufacture of other implements.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MANUFACTURES OF PUGET SOUND.</p>

<p>The Sound manufactures include only the weapons
and utensils used by the natives. Their articles were
made with the simplest tools of bone or shell. Blankets
were made of dog's hair,&mdash;large numbers of dogs being
raised for the purpose,&mdash;the wool of mountain sheep, or
wild goats, found on the mountain slopes, the down of
wild-fowl, cedar bark-fibre, ravellings of foreign blankets,
or more commonly of a mixture of several of these
materials. The fibre is twisted into yarn between the
hand and thigh, and the strands arranged in perpendicular
frames for weaving purposes. Willow and other
twigs supply material for baskets of various forms, often
neatly made and colored. Oil, both for domestic use
and for barter, is extracted by boiling, except in the case
of the candle-fish, when hanging in the hot sun suffices;
it is preserved in bladders and skin-bottles.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>Canoes are made by the Sound Indians in the same
manner as by the Nootkas already described; being always
dug out, formerly by fire, from a single cedar trunk,
and the form improved afterwards by stretching when
soaked in hot water. Of the most elegant proportions,
they are modeled by the builder with no guide but the
eye, and with most imperfect tools; three months' work
is sufficient to produce a medium-sized boat. The form
varies among different nations according as the canoe is
intended for ocean, sound, or river navigation; being
found with bow or stern, or both, in various forms, pointed,
round, shovel-nosed, raised or level. The raised
stern, head-piece, and stern-post are usually formed of
separate pieces. Like the Nootkas, they char and polish
the outside and paint the interior with red. The largest
and finest specimen seen by Mr. Swan was forty-six feet
long and six feet wide, and crossed the bar into Shoalwater
Bay with thirty Queniult Indians from the north.
The paddle used in deep water has a crutch-like handle
and a sharp-pointed blade.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRADE AND GOVERNMENT OF THE SOUND INDIANS.</p>

<p>In their barter between the different tribes, and in
estimating their wealth, the blanket is generally the unit
of value, and the <i>hiaqua</i>, a long white shell obtained off
Cape Flattery at a considerable depth, is also extensively
used for money, its value increasing with its length. A
kind of annual fair for trading purposes and festivities
is held by the tribes of Puget Sound at Bajada Point,
and here and in their other feasts they are fond of showing
their wealth and liberality by disposing of their surplus
property in gifts.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>The system of government seems to be of the simplest
nature, each individual being entirely independent and
master of his own actions. There is a nominal chief in
each tribe, who sometimes acquires great influence and
privileges by his wealth or personal prowess, but he has
no authority, and only directs the movements of his
band in warlike incursions. I find no evidence of hereditary
rank or caste except as wealth is sometimes
inherited.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Slaves are held by all the tribes, and are
treated very much like their dogs, being looked upon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
property, and not within the category of humanity. For
a master to kill half a dozen slaves is no wrong or cruelty;
it only tends to illustrate the owner's noble disposition
in so freely sacrificing his property. Slaves are
obtained by war and kidnapping, and are sold in large
numbers to northern tribes. According to Sproat, the
Classets, a rich and powerful tribe, encourage the slave-hunting
incursions of the Nootkas against their weaker
neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Wives are bought by presents, and some performances
or ceremonies, representative of hunting or fishing scenes,
not particularly described by any visitor, take place at
the wedding. Women have all the work to do except
hunting and fishing, while their lords spend their time
in idleness and gambling. Still the females are not ill-treated;
they acquire great influence in the tribe, and
are always consulted in matters of trade before a bargain
is closed. They are not overburdened with modesty,
nor are husbands noted for jealousy. Hiring out their
women, chiefly however slaves, for prostitution, has been
a prominent source of tribal revenue since the country
was partially settled by whites. Women are not prolific,
three or four being ordinarily the limit of their offspring.
Infants, properly bound up with the necessary apparatus
for head-flattening, are tied to their cradle or to a piece
of bark, and hung by a cord to the end of a springy pole
kept in motion by a string attached to the mother's great
toe. Affection for children is by no means rare, but in
few tribes can they resist the temptation to sell or gamble
them away.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">AMUSEMENTS OF THE SOUND INDIANS.</p>

<p>Feasting, gambling, and smoking are the favorite
amusements; all their property, slaves, children, and
even their own freedom in some cases are risked in
their games. Several plants are used as substitutes for
tobacco when that article is not obtainable. If any important
differences exist between their ceremonies, dances,
songs and feasts, and those of Vancouver Island, such
variations have not been recorded. In fact, many authors
describe the manners and customs of 'North-west
America' as if occupied by one people.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> There is no
evidence of cannibalism; indeed, during Vancouver's visit
at Puget Sound, some meat offered to the natives was
refused, because it was suspected to be human flesh.
Since their acquaintance with the whites they have acquired
a habit of assuming great names, as Duke of
York, or Jenny Lind, and highly prize scraps of paper
with writing purporting to substantiate their claims to
such distinctions. Their superstitions are many, and
they are continually on the watch in all the commonest
acts of life against the swarm of evil influences, from
which they may escape only by the greatest care.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE SOUND INDIANS.</p>

<p>Disorders of the throat and lungs, rheumatism and
intermittent fevers, are among the most prevalent forms
of disease, and in their methods of cure, as usual, the
absurd ceremonies, exorcisms, and gesticulations of the
medicine-men play the principal part; but hot and cold
baths are also often resorted to without regard to the
nature or stage of the malady.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The bodies of such as

succumb to their diseases, or to the means employed for
cure, are disposed of in different ways according to locality,
tribe, rank, or age. Skeletons are found by travelers
buried in the ground or deposited in a sitting
posture on its surface; in canoes or in boxes supported
by posts, or, more commonly, suspended from the branches
of trees. Corpses are wrapped in cloth or matting, and
more or less richly decorated according to the wealth of
the deceased. Several bodies are often put in one canoe
or box, and the bodies of young children are found suspended
in baskets. Property and implements, the latter
always broken, are deposited with or near the remains,
and these last resting-places of their people are religiously
cared for and guarded from intrusion by all the
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> All the peculiarities and inconsistencies of the

Nootka character perhaps have been noted by travelers
among the Indians of the Sound, but none of these peculiarities
are so clearly marked in the latter people. In
their character, as in other respects, they have little individuality,
and both their virtues and vices are but
faint reflections of the same qualities in the great families
north and south of their territory. The Cape Flattery
tribes are at once the most intelligent, bold, and
treacherous of all, while some of the tribes east and
north-east of the Sound proper have perhaps the best
reputation. Since the partial settlement of their territory
by the whites, the natives here as elsewhere have
lost many of their original characteristics, chiefly the
better ones. The remnants now for the most part are
collected on government reservations, or live in the vicinity
of towns, by begging and prostitution. Some tribes,
especially in the region of Bellingham Bay, have been
nominally converted to Christianity, have abandoned
polygamy, slavery, head-flattening, gambling, and superstitious
ceremonies, and pay considerable attention to a
somewhat mixed version of church doctrine and ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>
<p class="sidenote">THE CHINOOKS.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Chinooks</span> constitute the fourth division of the
Columbian group. Originally the name was restricted
to a tribe on the north bank of the Columbia between
Gray Bay and the ocean; afterwards, from a similarity
in language and customs, it was applied to all the bands
on both sides of the river, from its mouth to the Dalles.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
It is employed in this work to designate all the Oregon
tribes west of the Cascade Range, southward to the
Rogue River or Umpqua Mountains. This family lies
between the Sound Indians on the north and the Californian
group on the south, including in addition to
the tribes of the Columbia, those of the Willamette
Valley and the Coast. All closely resemble each other
in manners and customs, having also a general resemblance
to the northern families already described, springing
from their methods of obtaining food; and although
probably without linguistic affinities, except along the
Columbia River, they may be consistently treated as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
family&mdash;the last of the great coast or fish-eating divisions
of the Columbian group.</p>

<p>Among the prominent tribes, or nations of the Chinook
family may be mentioned the following: the <i>Watlalas</i>
or upper Chinooks, including the bands on the
Columbia from the Cascades to the Cowlitz, and on the
lower Willamette; the lower Chinooks from the Cowlitz
to the Pacific comprising the <i>Wakiakums</i> and <i>Chinooks</i>
on the north bank, and the <i>Cathlamets</i> and <i>Clatsops</i> on
the south; the <i>Calapooyas</i> occupying the Valley of the
Willamette, and the <i>Clackamas</i> on one of its chief tributaries
of the same name; with the <i>Killamooks</i> and <i>Umpquas</i>
who live between the Coast Range<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> and the ocean.</p>

<p>With respect to the present condition of these nations,
authorities agree in speaking of them as a squalid
and poverty-stricken race, once numerous and powerful,
now few and weak. Their country has been settled by
whites much more thickly than regions farther north, and
they have rapidly disappeared before the influx of strangers.
Whole tribes have been exterminated by war and
disease, and in the few miserable remnants collected on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
reservations or straggling about the Oregon towns, no
trace is apparent of the independent, easy-living bands
of the remote past.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> It is however to be noted that at
no time since this region has been known to Europeans
has the Indian population been at all in proportion to
the supporting capacity of the land, while yet in a state
of nature, with its fertile soil and well-stocked streams
and forests.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CHINOOK PHYSIQUE.</p>

<p>In physique the Chinook can not be said to differ materially
from the Nootka. In stature the men rarely
exceed five feet six inches, and the women five feet.
Both sexes are thick-set, but as a rule loosely built, although
in this respect they had doubtless degenerated
when described by most travelers. Their legs are bowed
and otherwise deformed by a constant squatting position
in and out of their canoes. Trained by constant exposure
with slight clothing, they endure cold and hunger
better than the white man, but to continued muscular
exertion they soon succumb. Physically they improve
in proportion to their distance from the Columbia and
its fisheries; the Calapooyas on the upper Willamette,
according to early visitors, presenting the finest specimens.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
Descending from the north along the coast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Hyperboreans, Columbians, and Californians gradually
assume a more dusky hue as we proceed southward.
The complexion of the Chinooks may be called a trifle
darker than the natives of the Sound, and of Vancouver;
though nothing is more difficult than from the vague
expressions of travelers to determine shades of color.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Points of resemblance have been noted by many observers
between the Chinook and Mongolian physiognomy,
consisting chiefly in the eyes turned obliquely
upward at the outer corner. The face is broad and
round, the nose flat and fat, with large nostrils, the
mouth wide and thick-lipped, teeth irregular and much
worn, eyes black, dull and expressionless; the hair generally
black and worn long, and the beard carefully
plucked out; nevertheless, their features are often regular.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">HEAD-FLATTENING PHENOMENON.</p>

<p>It is about the mouth of the Columbia that the custom
of flattening the head seems to have originated. Radiating
from this centre in all directions, and becoming
less universal and important as the distance is increased,
the usage terminates on the south with the nations
which I have attached to the Chinook family, is rarely
found east of the Cascade Range, but extends, as we
have seen, northward through all the coast families, although
it is far from being held in the same esteem in the
far north as in its apparently original centre. The origin
of this deformity is unknown. All we can do is to
refer it to that strange infatuation incident to humanity
which lies at the root of fashion and ornamentation, and
which even in these later times civilization is not able
to eradicate. As Alphonso the Wise regretted not having
been present at the creation&mdash;for then he would
have had the world to suit him&mdash;so different ages and
nations strive in various ways to remodel and improve
the human form. Thus the Chinese lady compresses
the feet, the European the waist, and the Chinook the
head. Slaves are not allowed to indulge in this extravagance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and as this class are generally of foreign tribes
or families, the work of ethnologists in classifying skulls
obtained by travelers, and thereby founding theories of
race is somewhat complicated; but the difficulty is lessened
by the fact that slaves receive no regular burial,
and hence all skulls belonging to bodies from native
cemeteries are known to be Chinook.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The Chinook
ideal of facial beauty is a straight line from the end of
the nose to the crown of the head. The flattening of
the skull is effected by binding the infant to its cradle
immediately after birth, and keeping it there from three
months to a year. The simplest form of cradle is a
piece of board or plank on which the child is laid upon
its back with the head slightly raised by a block of wood.
Another piece of wood, or bark, or leather, is then placed
over the forehead and tied to the plank with strings
which are tightened more and more each day until the
skull is shaped to the required pattern. Space is left
for lateral expansion; and under ordinary circumstances
the child's head is not allowed to leave its position until
the process is complete. The body and limbs are also
bound to the cradle, but more loosely, by bandages,
which are sometimes removed for cleansing purposes.
Moss or soft bark is generally introduced between the
skin and the wood, and in some tribes comfortable pads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
cushions, or rabbit-skins are employed. The piece of
wood which rests upon the forehead is in some cases attached
to the cradle by leather hinges, and instances are
mentioned where the pressure is created by a spring.
A trough or canoe-shaped cradle, dug out from a log,
often takes the place of the simple board, and among
the rich this is elaborately worked, and ornamented with
figures and shells. The child while undergoing this
process, with its small black eyes jammed half out of
their sockets, presents a revolting picture. Strangely
enough, however, the little prisoner seems to feel scarcely
any pain, and travelers almost universally state that no
perceptible injury is done to the health or brain. As
years advance the head partially but not altogether resumes
its natural form, and among aged persons the
effects are not very noticeable. As elsewhere, the personal
appearance of the women is of more importance
than that of the men, therefore the female child is subjected
more rigorously and longer to the compressing
process, than her brothers. Failure properly to mould
the cranium of her offspring gives to the Chinook matron
the reputation of a lazy and undutiful mother, and
subjects the neglected children to the ridicule of their
young companions;<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> so despotic is fashion. A practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
which renders the Chinook more hideous than the
compression of his skull is that of piercing or slitting the
cartilage of the nose and ears, and inserting therein long
strings of beads or hiaqua shells, the latter being prized
above all other ornaments. Tattooing seems to have
been practiced, but not extensively, taking usually the
form of lines of dots pricked into the arms, legs, and
cheeks with pulverized charcoal. Imitation tattooing,
with the bright-colored juices of different berries, was
a favorite pastime with the women, and neither sex
could resist the charms of salmon-grease and red clay.
In later times, however, according to Swan, the custom
of greasing and daubing the body has been to a great
extent abandoned. Great pains is taken in dressing
the hair, which is combed, parted in the middle, and
usually allowed to hang in long tresses down the back,
but often tied up in a queue by the women and girls, or
braided so as to hang in two tails tied with strings.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHINOOK DRESS.</p>

<p>For dress, skins were much more commonly used in
this region than among other coast families; particularly
the skins of the smaller animals, as the rabbit and woodrat.
These skins, dressed and often painted, were sewed
together so as to form a robe or blanket similar in form and
use to the more northern blanket of wool, which, as well
as a similar garment of goose-skin with the feathers on,
was also made and worn by the Chinooks, though not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
common use among them. They prefer to go naked
when the weather permits. Skins of larger animals, as
the deer and elk, are also used for clothing, and of the
latter is made a kind of arrow-proof armor for war; another
coat of mail being made of sticks bound together.
Females almost universally wear a skirt of cedar bark-fibre,
fastened about the waist and hanging to the knees.
This garment is woven for a few inches at the top, but
the rest is simply a hanging fringe, not very effectually
concealing the person. A substitute for this petticoat in
some tribes is a square piece of leather attached to a
belt in front; and in others a long strip of deer-skin
passed between the thighs and wound about the waist.
A fringed garment, like that described, is also sometimes
worn about the shoulders; in cold weather a fur robe is
wrapped about the body from the hips to the armpits,
forming a close and warm vest; and over all is sometimes
thrown a cape, or fur blanket, like that of the
men, varying in quality and value with the wealth of
the wearer. The best are made of strips of sea-otter
skin, woven with grass or cedar bark, so that the fur
shows on both sides. Chiefs and men of wealth wear
rich robes of otter and other valuable furs. The conical
hat woven of grass and bark, and painted in black and
white checks or with rude figures, with or without a brim,
and fastened under the chin, is the only covering for the
head.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS OF THE CHINOOKS.</p>

<p>The Chinooks moved about less for the purpose of obtaining
a supply of food, than many others, even of the
coast families, yet the accumulation of filth or&mdash;a much
stronger motive&mdash;of fleas, generally forced them to take
down their winter dwellings each spring, preserving
the materials for re-erection on the same or another
spot. The best houses were built of cedar planks attached
by bark-fibre cords to a frame, which consisted
of four corner, and two central posts and a ridge pole.
The planks of the sides and ends were sometimes perpendicular,
but oftener laid horizontally, overlapping here
in clapboard fashion as on the roof. In some localities
the roof and even the whole structure was of cedar bark.
These dwellings closely resembled those farther north,
but were somewhat inferior in size, twenty-five to seventy-five
feet long, and fifteen to twenty-five feet wide,
being the ordinary dimensions. On the Columbia they
were only four or five feet high at the eaves, but an
equal depth was excavated in the ground, while on the
Willamette the structure was built on the surface. The
door was only just large enough to admit the body, and
it was a favorite fancy of the natives to make it represent
the mouth of an immense head painted round it.
Windows there were none, nor chimney; one or more
fireplaces were sunk in the floor, and the smoke escaped
by the cracks, a plank in the roof being sometimes moved
for the purpose. Mats were spread on the floor and
raised berths were placed on the sides, sometimes in
several tiers. Partitions of plank or matting separated
the apartments of the several families. Smaller temporary
huts, and the permanent homes of the poorer Indians
were built in various forms, of sticks, covered with
bark, rushes, or skins. The interior and exterior of all
dwellings were in a state of chronic filth.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FISHERIES OF THE CHINOOKS.</p>

<p>The salmon fisheries of the Columbia are now famous
throughout the world. Once every year innumerable
multitudes of these noble fish enter the river from
the ocean to deposit their spawn. Impelled by instinct,
they struggle to reach the extreme limits of the stream,
working their way in blind desperation to the very sources
of every little branch, overcoming seeming impossibilities,
and only to fulfill their destiny and die; for if they
escape human enemies, they either kill themselves in
their mad efforts to leap impassable falls, or if their
efforts are crowned with success, they are supposed never
to return to the ocean. This fishery has always been
the chief and an inexhaustible source of food for the
Chinooks, who, although skillful fishermen, have not
been obliged to invent a great variety of methods or
implements for the capture of the salmon, which rarely
if ever have failed them. Certain ceremonies must,
however, be observed with the first fish taken; his meat
must be cut only with the grain, and the hearts of all
caught must be burned or eaten, and on no account be
thrown into the water or be devoured by a dog. With
these precautions there is no reason to suppose that the
Chinook would ever lack a supply of fish. The salmon
begin to run in April, but remain several weeks in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
warmer waters near the mouth, and are there taken
while in their best condition, by the Chinook tribe proper,
with a straight net of bark or roots, sometimes five hundred
feet long and fifteen feet deep, with floats and sinkers.
One end of the net is carried out into the river at
high water, and drawn in by the natives on the shore,
who with a mallet quiet the fish and prevent them
from jumping over the net and escaping. Farther up,
especially at the Cascades and at the falls of the Willamette,
salmon are speared by natives standing on the
rocks or on planks placed for the purpose; scooped up in
small dip-nets; or taken with a large unbaited hook attached
by a socket and short line to a long pole. There
is some account of artificial channels of rocks at these
places, but such expedients were generally not needed,
since, beside those caught by the Chinooks, such numbers
were cast on the rocks by their own efforts to leap the
falls, that the air for months was infected by the decaying
mass; and many of these in a palatable state of decay
were gathered by the natives for food. Hooks, spears,
and nets were sometimes rubbed with the juice of certain
plants supposed to be attractive to the fish. Once
taken, the salmon were cleaned by the women, dried
in the sun and smoked in the lodges; then they were
sometimes powdered fine between two stones, before packing
in skins or mats for winter use. The heads were
always eaten as favorite portions during the fishing season.
Next to the salmon the sturgeon was ranked as a
source of food. This fish, weighing from two hundred
to five hundred pounds, was taken by a baited hook,
sunk about twenty feet, and allowed to float down the
current; when hooked, the sturgeon rises suddenly and is
dispatched by a spear, lifted into the canoe by a gaff-hook,
or towed ashore. The Chinooks do not attack the
whale, but when one is accidentally cast upon the shore,
more or less decayed, a season of feasting ensues and the
native heart is glad. Many smaller varieties of fish are
taken by net, spear, hook, or rake, but no methods are
employed meriting special description. Wild fowl are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
snared or shot; elk and deer are shot with arrows or
taken in a carefully covered pit, dug in their favorite
haunts. As to the methods of taking rabbits and woodrats,
whose skins are said to have been so extensively
used for clothing, I find no information. Nuts, berries,
wild fruits and roots are all used as food, and to some
extent preserved for winter. The Wapato, a bulbous
root, compared by some to the potatoe and turnip, was
the aboriginal staple, and was gathered by women wading
in shallow ponds, and separating the root with their
toes.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Boiling in wooden kettles by means of hot
stones, was the usual manner of cooking, but roasting on
sticks stuck in the sand near the fire was also common.
Clam-shells and a few rude platters and spoons of wood
were in use, but the fingers, with the hair for a napkin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
were found much more convenient table ware.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> In all
their personal habits the Chinooks are disgustingly filthy,
although said to be fond of baths for health and pleasure.
The Clatsops, as reported by one visitor, form a
partial exception to this rule, as they occasionally wash
the hands and face.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS OF THE CHINOOKS.</p>

<p>Their chief weapons are bows and arrows, the former
of which is made of cedar, or occasionally, as it is said,
of horn and bone; its elasticity is increased by a covering
of sinew glued on. The arrow-head is of bone,
flint, or copper, and the shaft consists of a short piece of
some hard wood, and a longer one of a lighter material.
The bows are from two and a half to four feet long; five
styles, differing in form and curve, are pictured by Schoolcraft.
Another weapon in common use was a double-edged
wooden broad-sword, or sharp club, two and a half
or three feet long; spears, tomahawks, and scalping knives
are mentioned by many travelers, but not described, and
it is doubtful if either were ever used by these aborigines.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
I have already spoken of their thick arrow-proof
elk-skin armor, and of a coat of short sticks bound
together with grass; a bark helmet is also employed of
sufficient strength to ward off arrows and light blows.
Ross states that they also carry a circular elk-skin shield
about eighteen inches in diameter. Although by no
means a blood-thirsty race, the Chinook tribes were frequently
involved in quarrels, resulting, it is said, from
the abduction of women more frequently than from other
causes. They, like almost all other American tribes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
make a free use of war paint, laying it on grotesquely
and in bright colors; but unlike most other nations, they
never resorted to treachery, surprise, night attacks, or
massacre of women and children. Fighting was generally
done upon the water. When efforts to settle amicably
their differences, always the first expedient, failed,
a party of warriors, covered from head to foot with armor,
and armed with bows, arrows, and bludgeons, was paddled
by women to the enemies' village, where diplomatic
efforts for peace were renewed. If still unsuccessful, the
women were removed from danger, and the battle commenced,
or, if the hour was late, fighting was postponed
till the next morning. As their armor was arrow-proof
and as they rarely came near enough for hand-to-hand
conflict, the battles were of short duration and accompanied
by little bloodshed; the fall of a few warriors decided
the victory, the victors gained their point in the
original dispute, the vanquished paid some damages, and
the affair ended.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IMPLEMENTS, MANUFACTURES, BOATS.</p>

<p>Troughs dug out of one piece of cedar, and woven
baskets served this people for dishes, and were used for
every purpose. The best baskets were of silk grass or
fine fibre, of a conical form, woven in colors so closely
as to hold liquids, and with a capacity of from one to
six gallons. Coarser baskets were made of roots and
rushes, rude spoons of ash-wood, and circular mats did
duty as plates. Wapato diggers used a curved stick
with handle of horn; fish-hooks and spears were made
of wood and bone in a variety of forms; the wing-bone
of the crane supplied a needle. With regard to their
original cutting instruments, by which trees were felled
for canoes or for planks which were split off by wedges,
there is much uncertainty; since nearly all authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
state that before their intercourse with Europeans, chisels
made of 'old files,' were employed, and driven by an oblong
stone or a spruce-knot mallet. Pipe-bowls were of hard
wood fitted to an elder stem, but the best ones, of stone elegantly
carved, were of Haidah manufacture and obtained
from the north.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> To kindle a fire the Chinook twirls
rapidly between the palms a cedar stick, the point of
which is pressed into a small hollow in a flat piece of the
same material, the sparks falling on finely-frayed bark.
Sticks are commonly carried for the purpose, improving
with use. Besides woven baskets, matting is the chief
article of Chinook manufacture. It is made by the women
by placing side by side common bulrushes or flags
about three feet long, tying the ends, and passing strings
of twisted rushes through the whole length, sometimes
twenty or thirty feet, about four inches apart, by means
of a bone needle.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Chinook boats do not differ essentially, either in material,
form, or method of manufacture, from those already
described as in use among the Sound family. Always dug
out of a single log of the common white cedar, they vary in
length from ten to fifty feet, and in form according to the
waters they are intended to navigate or the freight they
are to carry. In these canoes lightness, strength, and elegance
combine to make them perfect models of water-craft.
Lewis and Clarke describe four forms in use in
this region, and their description of boats, as of most other
matters connected with this people, has been taken with
or without credit by nearly all who have treated of the
subject. I cannot do better than to give their account
of the largest and best boats used by the Killamooks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
other tribes on the coast outside the river. "The sides
are secured by cross-bars, or round sticks, two or three
inches in thickness, which are inserted through holes
just below the gunwale, and made fast with cords. The
upper edge of the gunwale itself is about five-eighths
of an inch thick, and four or five in breadth, and folds
outwards, so as to form a kind of rim, which prevents
the water from beating into the boat. The bow and stern
are about the same height, and each provided with a
comb, reaching to the bottom of the boat. At each end,
also, are pedestals, formed of the same solid piece, on
which are placed strange grotesque figures of men or
animals, rising sometimes to the height of five feet, and
composed of small pieces of wood, firmly united, with great
ingenuity, by inlaying and mortising, without a spike
of any kind. The paddle is usually from four feet and
a half to five feet in length; the handle being thick for
one-third of its length, when it widens, and is hollowed
and thinned on each side of the centre, which forms a
sort of rib. When they embark, one Indian sits in the
stern, and steers with a paddle, the others kneel in pairs
in the bottom of the canoe, and sitting on their heels,
paddle over the gunwale next to them. In this way
they ride with perfect safety the highest waves, and venture
without the least concern in seas where other boats
or seamen could not live an instant." The women are
as expert as the men in the management of canoes.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHINOOK PROPERTY AND TRADE.</p>

<p>The Chinooks were always a commercial rather than
a warlike people, and are excelled by none in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
shrewdness at bargaining. Before the arrival of the
Europeans they repaired annually to the region of the
Cascades and Dalles, where they met the tribes of the
interior, with whom they exchanged their few articles of
trade&mdash;fish, oil, shells, and Wapato&mdash;for the skins, roots,
and grasses of their eastern neighbors. The coming of
ships to the coast gave the Chinooks the advantage in
this trade, since they controlled the traffic in beads,
trinkets and weapons; they found also in the strangers
ready buyers of the skins obtained from the interior in
exchange for these articles. Their original currency or
standard of value was the hiaqua shell from the northern
coast, whose value was in proportion to its length, a
fathom string of forty shells being worth nearly double
a string of fifty to the fathom. Since the white men
came, beaver-skins and blankets have been added to their
currency. Individuals were protected in their rights to
personal property, such as slaves, canoes, and implements,
but they had no idea of personal property in
lands, the title to which rested in the tribe for purposes
of fishing and the chase.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>In decorative art this family cannot be said to hold a
high place compared with more northern nations, their
only superior work being the modeling of their canoes,
and the weaving of ornamental baskets. In carving
they are far inferior to the Haidahs; the Cathlamets, according
to Lewis and Clarke, being somewhat superior
to the others, or at least more fond of the art. Their
attempts at painting are exceedingly rude.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>Little can be said of their system of government except
that it was eminently successful in producing peaceful
and well regulated communities. Each band or
village was usually a sovereignty, nominally ruled by a
chief, either hereditary or selected for his wealth and popularity,
who exerted over his tribe influence rather than
authority, but who was rarely opposed in his measures.
Sometimes a league existed, more or less permanent, for
warlike expeditions. Slight offenses against usage&mdash;the
tribal common law&mdash;were expiated by the payment of
an amount of property satisfactory to the party offended.
Theft was an offense, but the return of the article stolen
removed every trace of dishonor. Serious crimes, as the
robbery of a burial-place, were sometimes punished with
death by the people, but no special authorities or processes
seem to have been employed, either for detection
or punishment.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Slavery, common to all the coast families, is also
practiced by the Chinooks, but there is less difference
here perhaps than elsewhere between the condition of
the slaves and the free. Obtained from without the
limits of the family, towards the south or east, by war,
or more commonly by trade, the slaves are obliged to
perform all the drudgery for their masters, and their
children must remain in their parents' condition, their
round heads serving as a distinguishing mark from freemen.
But the amount of the work connected with the
Chinook household is never great, and so long as the
slaves are well and strong, they are liberally fed and well
treated. True, many instances are known of slaves
murdered by the whim of a cruel and rich master, and
it was not very uncommon to kill slaves on the occasion
of the death of prominent persons, but wives and friends
are also known to have been sacrificed on similar occasions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
No burial rights are accorded to slaves, and
no care taken of them in serious illness; when unable to
work they are left to die, and their bodies cast into the
sea or forest as food for fish or beast. It was not a rare
occurrence for a freeman to voluntarily subject himself
to servitude in payment of a gambling-debt; nor for a
slave to be adopted into the tribe, and the privilege of
head-flattening accorded to his offspring.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MARITAL RELATIONS OF THE CHINOOKS.</p>

<p>Not only were the Chinooks a peaceable people in
their tribal intercourse, but eminently so in their family
relations. The young men when they married brought
their wives to their father's home, and thus several generations
lived amicably in their large dwellings until
forced to separate by numbers, the chief authority being
exercised not by the oldest but by the most active and
useful member of the household. Overtures for marriage
were made by friends of the would-be bridegroom,
who offered a certain price, and if accepted by the maiden's
parents, the wedding ceremony was celebrated simply
by an interchange and exhibition of presents with
the congratulations of invited guests. A man might
take as many wives as he could buy and support, and
all lived together without jealousy; but practically few,
and those among the rich and powerful, indulged in
the luxury of more than one wife. It has been noticed
that there was often great disparity in the ages of bride
and groom, for, say the Chinooks, a very young or very
aged couple lack either the experience or the activity
necessary for fighting the battles of life. Divorce or
separation is easily accomplished, but is not of frequent
occurrence. A husband can repudiate his wife for infidelity,
or any cause of dissatisfaction, and she can marry
again. Some cases are known of infidelity punished with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
death. Barrenness is common, the birth of twins rare,
and families do not usually exceed two children. Childbirth,
as elsewhere among aboriginals, is accompanied
with but little inconvenience, and children are often
nursed until three or five years old. They are carried
about on the mother's back until able to walk; at first in
the head-flattening cradle, and later in wicker baskets.
Unmarried women have not the slightest idea of chastity,
and freely bestow their favors in return for a kindness,
or for a very small consideration in property paid
to themselves or parents. When married, all this is
changed&mdash;female virtue acquires a marketable value, the
possessorship being lodged in the man and not in the
woman. Rarely are wives unfaithful to their husbands;
but the chastity of the wife is the recognized property
of the husband, who sells it whenever he pleases. Although
attaching no honor to chastity, the Chinook
woman feels something like shame at becoming the
mother of an illegitimate child, and it is supposed to be
partly from this instinct, that infanticide and abortion
are of frequent occurrence. At her first menstruation a
girl must perform a certain penance, much less severe,
however, than among the northern nations. In some
tribes she must bathe frequently for a moon, and rub
the body with rotten hemlock, carefully abstaining from
all fish and berries which are in season, and remaining
closely in the house during a south wind. Did she partake
of the forbidden food, the fish would leave the
streams and the berries drop from the bushes; or did she
go out in a south wind, the thunder-bird would come and
shake his wings. All thunder-storms are thus caused.
Both young children and the old and infirm are kindly
treated. Work is equally divided between the sexes;
the women prepare the food which the men provide;
they also manufacture baskets and matting; they are
nearly as skillful as the men with the canoe, and are
consulted on all important matters. Their condition is
by no means a hard one. It is among tribes that live
by the chase or by other means in which women can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of little service, that we find the sex most oppressed and
cruelly treated.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHINOOK FEASTS AND FESTIVITIES.</p>

<p>Like all Indians, the Chinooks are fond of feasting,
but their feasts are simply the coming together of men
and women during the fishing season with the determination
to eat as much as possible, and this meeting is devoid
of those complicated ceremonies of invitation, reception,
and social etiquette, observed farther north; nor has any
traveler noticed the distribution of property as a feature
of these festivals. Fantastically dressed and gaudily
decked with paint, they are wont to jump about on certain
occasions in a hopping, jolting kind of dance, accompanied
by songs, beating of sticks, clapping of hands,
and occasional yells, the women usually dancing in a
separate set. As few visitors mention their dances, it is
probable that dancing was less prevalent than with others.
Their songs were often soft and pleasing, differing in style
for various occasions, the words extemporized, the tunes
being often sung with meaningless sounds, like our tra-la-la.
Swan gives examples of the music used under different
circumstances. Smoking was universal, the leaves
of the bear-berry being employed, mixed in later times
with tobacco obtained from the whites. Smoke is swallowed
and retained in the stomach and lungs until partial
intoxication ensues. No intoxicating drink was known
to them before the whites came, and after their coming
for a little time they looked on strong drink with suspicion,
and were averse to its use. They are sometimes
sober even now, when no whisky is at hand. But the
favorite amusement of all the Chinook nations is gambling,
which occupies the larger part of their time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
not engaged in sleeping, eating, or absolutely necessary
work. In their games they risk all their property, their
wives and children, and in many instances their own
freedom, losing all with composure, and nearly always
accompanying the game with a song. Two persons, or
two parties large or small, play one against the other; a
banking game is also in vogue, in which one individual
plays against all comers. A favorite method is to pass
rapidly from hand to hand two small sticks, one of which
is marked, the opponent meanwhile guessing at the hand
containing the marked stick. The sticks sometimes take
the form of discs of the size of a silver dollar, each player
having ten; these are wrapped in a mass of fine bark-fibre,
shuffled and separated in two portions; the winner
naming the bunch containing the marked or trump piece.
Differently marked sticks may also be shuffled or tossed
in the air, and the lucky player correctly names the relative
position in which they shall fall. A favorite game
of females, called <i>ahikia</i>, is played with beaver-teeth,
having figured sides, which are thrown like dice; the
issue depends on the combinations of figures which are
turned up. In all these games the players squat upon
mats; sticks are used as counters; and an essential point
for a successful gambler is to make as much noise as possible,
in order to confuse the judgment of opponents.
In still another game the players attempt to roll small
pieces of wood between two pins set up a few inches apart,
at a distance of ten feet, into a hole in the floor just
beyond. The only sports of an athletic nature are shooting
at targets with arrows and spears, and a game of ball
in which two goals are placed a mile apart, and each
party&mdash;sometimes a whole tribe&mdash;endeavors to force the
ball past the other's goal, as in foot-ball, except that the
ball is thrown with a stick, to one end of which is fixed
a small hoop or ring.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Children's sports are described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
only by Swan, and as rag babies and imitated Catholic
baptisms were the favorite pastimes mentioned, they may
be supposed not altogether aboriginal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS AND SUPERSTITIONS.</p>

<p>Personal names with the Chinooks are hereditary, but
in many cases they either have no meaning or their
original signification is soon forgotten. They are averse
to telling their true name to strangers, for fear, as they
sometimes say, that it may be stolen; the truth is, however,
that with them the name assumes a personality; it
is the shadow or spirit, or other self, of the flesh and
blood person, and between the name and the individual
there is a mysterious connection, and injury cannot be
done to one without affecting the other; therefore, to
give one's name to a friend is a high mark of Chinook
favor. No account is kept of age. They are believers
in sorcery and secret influences, and not without fear of
their medicine-men or conjurers, but, except perhaps
in their quality of physicians, the latter do not exert the
influence which is theirs farther north; their ceremonies
and tricks are consequently fewer and less ridiculous.
Inventions of the whites not understood by the natives
are looked on with great superstition. It was, for instance,
very difficult at first to persuade them to risk
their lives before a photographic apparatus, and this for
the reason before mentioned; they fancied that their
spirit thus passed into the keeping of others, who could
torment it at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Consumption, liver complaint
and ophthalmia are the most prevalent Chinook maladies;
to which, since the whites came, fever and ague have been
added, and have killed eighty or ninety per cent. of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
whole people, utterly exterminating some tribes. The
cause of this excessive mortality is supposed to be the
native method of treatment, which allays a raging fever
by plunging the patient in the river or sea. On the
Columbia this alleviating plunge is preceded by violent
perspiration in a vapor bath; consequently the treatment
has been much more fatal there than on the coast
where the vapor bath is not in use. For slight ills and
pains, especially for external injuries, the Chinooks employ
simple remedies obtained from various plants and
trees. Many of these remedies have been found to be
of actual value, while others are evidently quack nostrums,
as when the ashes of the hair of particular animals
are considered essential ingredients of certain ointments.
Fasting and bathing serve to relieve many slight internal
complaints. Strangely enough, they never suffer from
diseases of the digestive organs, notwithstanding the
greasy compounds used as food. When illness becomes
serious or refuses to yield to simple treatment, the conclusion
is that either the spirits of the dead are striving
to remove the spirit of the sick person from the troubles
of earth to a happier existence, or certain evil spirits
prefer this world and the patient's body for their dwelling-place.
Then the doctor is summoned. Medical
celebrities are numerous, each with his favorite method
of treatment, but all agree that singing, beating of sticks,
indeed a noise, however made, accompanied by mysterious
passes and motions, with violent pressure and kneading
of the body are indispensable. The patient frequently
survives the treatment. Several observers believe that
mesmeric influences are exerted, sometimes with benefit,
by the doctors in their mummeries.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHINOOK BURIAL RITES.</p>

<p>When the Chinook dies, relatives are careful to speak
in whispers, and indulge in no loud manifestations of
grief so long as the body remains in the house. The
body is prepared for final disposition by wrapping it in
blankets, together with ornaments and other property of
a valuable but not bulky nature. For a burial place an
elevated but retired spot near the river bank or on an
island is almost always selected, but the methods of disposing
of the dead in these cemeteries differ somewhat
among the various tribes. In the region about the mouth
of the Columbia, the body with its wrappings is placed in
the best canoe of the deceased, which is washed for the
purpose, covered with additional blankets, mats, and property,
again covered, when the deceased is of the richer
class, by another inverted canoe, the whole bound together
with matting and cords, and deposited usually on
a plank platform five or six feet high, but sometimes
suspended from the branches of trees, or even left on the
surface of the ground. The more bulky articles of property,
such as utensils, and weapons, are deposited about or
hung from the platform, being previously spoiled for use
that they may not tempt desecrators among the whites or
foreign tribes; or, it may be that the sacrifice or death of
the implements is necessary before the spirits of the implements
can accompany the spirit of the owner. For the
same purpose, and to allow the water to pass off, holes are
bored in the bottom of the canoe, the head of the corpse
being raised a little higher than the feet. Some travelers
have observed a uniformity in the position of the canoe,
the head pointing towards the east, or down the current
of the stream. After about a year, the bones are sometimes
taken out and buried, but the canoe and platform
are never removed. Chiefs' canoes are often repainted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Farther up both the Columbia and Willamette Rivers,
excavations of little depth are often made, in which
bodies are deposited on horizontal boards and covered
over with a slightly inclining roof of heavy planks or
poles. In these vaults several tiers of corpses are often
placed one above another. At the Cascades, depositories
of the dead have been noticed in the form of a roofed
inclosure of planks, eight feet long, six feet wide, and
five feet high, with a door in one end, and the whole
exterior painted. The Calapooyas also buried their dead
in regular graves, over which was erected a wooden
head-board. Desecration of burial places is a great crime
with the Chinook; he also attaches great importance to
having his bones rest in his tribal cemetery wherever he
may die. For a long time after a death, relatives repair
daily at sunrise and sunset to the vicinity of the grave
to sing songs of mourning and praise. Until the bones
are finally disposed of, the name of the deceased must
not be spoken, and for several years it is spoken only
with great reluctance. Near relatives often change their
name under the impression that spirits will be attracted
back to earth if they hear familiar names often repeated.
Chiefs are supposed to die through the evil influence of
another person, and the suspected, though a dear friend,
was formerly often sacrificed. The dead bodies of slaves
are never touched save by other slaves.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHINOOK CHARACTER.</p>

<p>There is little difference of opinion concerning the
character of the Chinooks. All agree that they are intelligent
and very acute in trade; some travelers have
found them at different points harmless and inoffensive;
and in a few instances honesty has been detected. So
much for their good qualities. As to the bad, there is
unanimity nearly as great that they are thieves and liars,
and for the rest each observer applies to them a selection
of such adjectives as lazy, superstitious, cowardly, inquisitive,
intrusive, libidinous, treacherous, turbulent,
hypocritical, fickle, etc. The Clatsops, with some authors,
have the reputation of being the most honest and moral;
for the lowest position in the scale all the rest might
present a claim. It should however be said in their
favor that they are devotedly attached to their homes,
and treat kindly both their young children and aged
parents; also that not a few of their bad traits originated
with or have been aggravated by contact with civilization.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Inland Families</span>, constituting the fifth and last
division of the Columbians, inhabit the region between
the Cascade Range and the eastern limit of what I term
the Pacific States, from 52° 30´ to 45° of north latitude.
These bounds are tolerably distinct; though that on the
south, separating the eastern portions of the Columbian
and Californian groups, is irregular and marked by no
great river, mountain chain, or other prominent physical
feature. These inland natives of the Northwest occupy,
in person, character, and customs, as well as in the location
of their home, an intermediate position between the
coast people already described&mdash;to whom they are pronounced
superior in most respects&mdash;and the Rocky
Mountain or eastern tribes. Travelers crossing the
Rocky Mountains into this territory from the east, or
entering it from the Pacific by way of the Columbia or
Fraser, note contrasts on passing the limits, sufficient to
justify me in regarding its inhabitants as one people for
the purposes aimed at in this volume.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Instead, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of treating each family separately, as has been
done with the coast divisions of the group, I deem it more
convenient, as well as less monotonous to the reader, to
avoid repetition by describing the manners and customs
of all the people within these limits together, taking
care to note such variations as may be found to exist.
The division into families and nations, made according
to principles already sufficiently explained, is as follows,
beginning again at the north:</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SHUSHWAPS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Shushwaps</span>, our first family division, live between
52° 30´ and 49° in the interior of British Columbia,
occupying the valleys of the Fraser, Thompson, and
Upper Columbia rivers with their tributary streams and
lakes. They are bounded on the west by the Nootkas
and on the north by the Carriers, from both of which
families they seem to be distinct. As national divisions
of this family may be mentioned the Shushwaps proper,
or <i>Atnahs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> who occupy the whole northern portion of
the territory; the <i>Okanagans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> in the valley of the lake
and river of the same name; and the <i>Kootenais</i>,<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
inhabit the triangle bounded by the Upper Columbia,
the Rocky Mountains, and the 49th parallel, living
chiefly on Flatbow river and lake. All three nations
might probably be joined with quite as much reason to
the Salish family farther south, as indeed has usually
been done with the Okanagans; while the Kootenais are
by some considered distinct from any of their adjoining
nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Salish Family</span> dwells south of the Shushwaps,
between 49° and 47°, altogether on the Columbia and its
tributaries. Its nations, more clearly defined than in
most other families, are the <i>Flatheads</i>,<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> or Salish proper,
between the Bitter Root and Rocky Mountains on Flathead
and Clarke rivers; the <i>Pend d'Oreilles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> who dwell
about the lake of the same name and on Clarke River,
for fifty to seventy-five miles above and below the lake;
the <i>Coeurs d'Alêne</i>,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> south of the Pend d'Oreilles, on
Coeur d'Alêne Lake and the streams falling into it; the
<i>Colvilles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> a term which may be used to designate the
variously named bands about Kettle Falls, and northward
along the Columbia to the Arrow Lakes; the <i>Spokanes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
on the Spokane River and plateau along the
Columbia below Kettle Falls, nearly to the mouth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Okanagan; and the <i>Pisquouse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> on the west bank of the
Columbia between the Okanagan and Priest Rapids.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SAHAPTIN FAMILY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sahaptin Family</span>, the last of the Columbian
group, is immediately south of the Salish, between the
Cascade and Bitter Root mountains, reaching southward,
in general terms, to the forty-fifth parallel, but very irregularly
bounded by the Shoshone tribes of the Californian
group. Of its nations, the <i>Nez Percés</i>,<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> or Sahaptins
proper, dwell on the Clearwater and its branches,
and on the Snake about the forks; the <i>Palouse</i><a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> occupy
the region north of the Snake about the mouth of the
Palouse; the south banks of the Columbia and Snake
near their confluence, and the banks of the lower Walla
Walla are occupied by the <i>Walla Wallas</i>;<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> the <i>Yakimas</i>
and <i>Kliketats</i><a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> inhabit the region north of the Dalles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
between the Cascade Range and the Columbia, the former
in the valley of the Yakima, the latter in the mountains
about Mt. Adams. Both nations extend in some bands
across into the territory of the Sound family. The natives
of Oregon east of the Cascade Range, who have not
usually been included in the Sahaptin family, I will divide
somewhat arbitrarily into the <i>Wascos</i>, extending
from the mountains eastward to John Day River, and
the <i>Cayuse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> from this river across the Blue Mountains
to the Grande Ronde.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSIQUE OF THE INLAND TRIBES.</p>

<p>The inland Columbians are of medium stature, usually
from five feet seven to five feet ten inches, but sometimes
reaching a height of six feet; spare in flesh, but
muscular and symmetrical; with well-formed limbs, the
legs not being deformed as among the Chinooks by constant
sitting in the canoe; feet and hands are in many
tribes small and well made. In bodily strength they
are inferior to whites, but superior, as might be expected
from their habits, to the more indolent fish-eaters on the
Pacific. The women, though never corpulent, are more
inclined to rotundity than the men. The Nez Percés
and Cayuses are considered the best specimens, while in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
the north the Kootenais seem to be superior to the other
Shushwap nations. The Salish are assigned by Wilkes
and Hale an intermediate place in physical attributes
between the coast and mountain tribes, being in stature
and proportion superior to the Chinooks, but inferior to
the Nez Percés.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Inland, a higher order of face is observed
than on the coast. The cheek-bones are still
high, the forehead is rather low, the face long, the eyes
black, rarely oblique, the nose prominent and frequently
aquiline, the lips thin, the teeth white and regular but
generally much worn. The general expression of the
features is stern, often melancholy, but not as a rule
harsh or repulsive. Dignified, fine-looking men, and
handsome young women have been remarked in nearly
all the tribes, but here again the Sahaptins bear off the
palm. The complexion is not darker than on the coast,
but has more of a coppery hue. The hair is black, generally
coarse, and worn long. The beard is very thin,
and its growth is carefully prevented by plucking.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">HEAD-FLATTENING IN THE INTERIOR.</p>

<p>The custom of head-flattening, apparently of seaboard
origin and growth, extends, nevertheless, across the Cascade
barrier, and is practiced to a greater or less extent
by all the tribes of the Sahaptin family. Among them
all, however, with the exception perhaps of the Kliketats,
the deformity consists only of a very slight compression
of the forehead, which nearly or quite disappears
at maturity. The practice also extends inland up
the valley of the Fraser, and is found at least in nearly
all the more western tribes of the Shushwaps. The Salish
family do not flatten the skull.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Other methods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
deforming the person, such as tattooing and perforating
the features are as a rule not employed; the Yakimas
and Kliketats, however, with some other lower Columbia
tribes, pierce or cut away the septum of the nose,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
and the Nez Percés probably derived their name from a
similar custom formerly practiced by them. Paint, however,
is used by all inland as well as coast tribes on
occasions when decoration is desired, but applied in less
profusion by the latter. The favorite color is vermilion,
applied as a rule only to the face and hair.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Elaborate
hair-dressing is not common, and both sexes usually wear
the hair in the same style, soaked in grease, often painted,
and hanging in a natural state, or in braids, plaits, or
queues, over the shoulders. Some of the southern tribes
cut the hair across the forehead, while others farther
north tie it up in knots on the back of the head.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>The coast dress&mdash;robes or blankets of bark-fibre or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
small skins&mdash;is also used for some distance inland on
the banks of the Columbia and Fraser, as among the
Nicoutamuch, Kliketats, and Wascos; but the distinctive
inland dress is of dressed skin of deer, antelope, or mountain
sheep; made into a rude frock, or shirt, with loose
sleeves; leggins reaching half-way up the thigh, and
either bound to the leg or attached by strings to a belt
about the waist; moccasins, and rarely a cap. Men's
frocks descend half-way to the knees; women's nearly
to the ankles. Over this dress, or to conceal the want
of some part of it, a buffalo or elk robe is worn, especially
in winter. All garments are profusely and often
tastefully decorated with leather fringes, feathers, shells,
and porcupine quills; beads, trinkets and various bright-colored
cloths having been added to Indian ornamentation
since the whites came. A new suit of this native
skin clothing is not without beauty, but by most tribes
the suit is worn without change till nearly ready to drop
off, and becomes disgustingly filthy. Some tribes clean
and whiten their clothing occasionally with white earth,
or pipe-clay. The buffalo and most of the other large
skins are obtained from the country east of the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">INLAND DWELLINGS.</p>

<p>The inland dwelling is a frame of poles, covered with
rush matting, or with the skins of the buffalo or elk.
As a rule the richest tribes and individuals use skins,
although many of the finest Sahaptin houses are covered
with mats only. Notwithstanding these nations are rich
in horses, I find no mention that horse-hides are ever
employed for this or any other purpose. The form of
the lodge is that of a tent, conical or oblong, and usually
sharp at the top, where an open space is left for light
and air to enter, and smoke to escape. Their internal
condition presents a marked contrast with that of the
Chinook and Nootka habitations, since they are by many
interior tribes kept free from vermin and filth. Their
light material and the frequency with which their location
is changed contributes to this result. The lodges
are pitched by the women, who acquire great skill and
celerity in the work. Holes are left along the sides for
entrance, and within, a floor of sticks is laid, or more
frequently the ground is spread with mats, and skins
serve for beds. Dwellings are often built sufficiently
large to accommodate many families, each of which in
such case has its own fireplace on a central longitudinal
line, a definite space being allotted for its goods, but no
dividing partitions are ever used. The dwellings are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
arranged in small villages generally located in winter on
the banks of small streams a little away from the main
rivers. For a short distance up the Columbia, houses
similar to those of the Chinooks are built of split cedar
and bark. The Walla Wallas, living in summer in the
ordinary mat lodge, often construct for winter a subterranean
abode by digging a circular hole ten or twelve
feet deep, roofing it with poles or split cedar covered
with grass and mud, leaving a small opening at the top
for exit and entrance by means of a notched-log ladder.
The Atnahs on Fraser River spend the winter in similar
structures, a simple slant roof of mats or bark sufficing
for shade and shelter in summer. The Okanagans construct
their lodges over an excavation in the ground
several feet deep, and like many other nations, cover
their matting in winter with grass and earth.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE INLAND NATIONS.</p>

<p>The inland families eat fish and game, with roots and
fruit; no nation subsists without all these supplies; but
the proportion of each consumed varies greatly according
to locality. Some tribes divide their forces regularly
into bands, of men to fish and hunt, of women to cure
fish and flesh, and to gather roots and berries. I have
spoken of the coast tribes as a fish-eating, and the interior
tribes as a hunting people, attributing in great
degree their differences of person and character to their
food, or rather to their methods of obtaining it; yet fish
constitutes an important element of inland subsistence
as well. Few tribes live altogether without salmon,
the great staple of the Northwest; since those dwelling
on streams inaccessible to the salmon by reason of intervening
falls, obtain their supply by annual migrations
to the fishing-grounds, or by trade with other nations.
The principal salmon fisheries of the Columbia are at
the Dalles, the falls ten miles above, and at Kettle
Falls. Other productive stations are on the Powder,
Snake, Yakima, Okanagan, and Clarke rivers. On the
Fraser, which has no falls in its lower course, fishing is
carried on all along the banks of the river instead of at
regular stations, as on the Columbia. Nets, weirs, hooks,
spears, and all the implements and methods by which
fish are taken and cured have been sufficiently described
in treating of the coast region; in the interior I find no
important variations except in the basket method in use
at the Chaudières or Kettle Falls by the Quiarlpi tribe.
Here an immense willow basket, often ten feet in diameter
and twelve feet deep, is suspended at the falls from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
strong timbers fixed in crevices of the rocks, and above
this is a frame so attached that the salmon in attempting
to leap the fall strike the sticks of the frame and are
thrown back into the basket, in the largest of which
naked men armed with clubs await them. Five thousand
pounds of salmon have thus been taken in a day
by means of a single basket. During the fishing-season
the Salmon Chief has full authority; his basket is the
largest, and must be located a month before others are
allowed to fish. The small nets used in the same region
have also the peculiarity of a stick which keeps the
mouth open when the net is empty, but is removed by
the weight of the fish. Besides the salmon, sturgeon are
extensively taken in the Fraser, and in the Arrow Lakes,
while trout and other varieties of small fish abound in
most of the streams. The fishing-season is the summer,
between June and September, varying a month or more
according to locality. This is also the season of trade
and festivity, when tribes from all directions assemble
to exchange commodities, gamble, dance, and in later
times to drink and fight.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">HUNTING BY SHUSHWAPS, SALISH, AND SAHAPTINS.</p>

<p>The larger varieties of game are hunted by the natives
on horseback wherever the nature of the country will
permit. Buffalo are now never found west of the Rocky
Mountains, and there are but few localities where large
game has ever been abundant, at least since the country
became known to white men. Consequently the Flatheads,
Nez Percés, and Kootenais, the distinctively hunting
nations, as well as bands from nearly every other tribe,
cross the mountains once or twice each year, penetrating
to the buffalo-plains between the Yellowstone and the
Missouri, in the territory of hostile nations. The bow
and arrow was the weapon with which buffalo and all
other game were shot. No peculiar cunning seems to
have been necessary to the native hunter of buffalo; he
had only to ride into the immense herds on his well-trained
horse, and select the fattest animals for his arrows.
Various devices are mentioned as being practiced
in the chase of deer, elk, and mountain sheep; such as
driving them by a circle of fire on the prairie towards
the concealed hunters, or approaching within arrow-shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
by skillful manipulations of a decoy animal; or the
frightened deer are driven into an ambush by converging
lines of bright-colored rags so placed in the bushes
as to represent men. Kane states that about the Arrow
Lakes hunting dogs are trained to follow the deer and
to bring back the game to their masters even from very
long distances. Deer are also pursued in the winter on
snow-shoes, and in deep snow often knocked down with
clubs. Bear and beaver are trapped in some places; and,
especially about the northern lakes and marshes, wild
fowl are very abundant, and help materially to eke out
the supply of native food.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD AND ITS PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Their natural improvidence, or an occasional unlucky
hunting or fishing season, often reduces them to want,
and in such case the resort is to roots, berries, and mosses,
several varieties of which are also gathered and laid up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
as a part of their regular winter supplies. Chief among
the roots are the camass, a sweet, onion-like bulb, which
grows in moist prairies, the couse, which flourishes in
more sterile and rocky spots, and the bitter-root, which
names a valley and mountain range. To obtain these
roots the natives make regular migrations, as for game
or fish. The varieties of roots and berries used for food
are very numerous; and none seem to grow in the country
which to the native taste are unpalatable or injurious,
though many are both to the European.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Towards obtaining food the men hunt and fish; all
the other work of digging roots, picking berries, as well
as dressing, preserving, and cooking all kinds of food is
done by the women, with some exceptions among the
Nez Percés and Pend d'Oreilles. Buffalo-meat is jerked
by cutting in thin pieces and drying in the sun and over
smouldering fires on scaffolds of poles. Fish is sun-dried
on scaffolds, and by some tribes on the lower Columbia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
is also pulverized between two stones and packed in
baskets lined with fish-skin. Here, as on the coast, the
heads and offal only are eaten during the fishing-season.
The Walla Wallas are said usually to eat fish without
cooking. Roots, mosses, and such berries as are preserved,
are usually kept in cakes, which for eating are
moistened, mixed in various proportions and cooked, or
eaten without preparation. To make the cakes simply
drying, pulverizing, moistening, and sun-drying usually
suffice; but camas and pine-moss are baked or fermented
for several days in an underground kiln by means of hot
stones, coming out in the form of a dark gluey paste of
the proper consistency for moulding. Many of these
powdered roots may be preserved for years without injury.
Boiling by means of hot stones and roasting on
sharp sticks fixed in the ground near the fire, are the
universal methods of cooking. No mention is made of
peculiar customs in eating; to eat often and much is the
aim; the style of serving is a secondary consideration.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Life with all these nations is but a struggle for food,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and the poorer tribes are often reduced nearly to starvation;
yet they never are known to kill dogs or horses
for food. About the missions and on the reservations
cattle have been introduced and the soil is cultivated by
the natives to considerable extent.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PERSONAL HABITS IN THE INTERIOR.</p>

<p>In their personal habits, as well as the care of their
lodges, the Cayuses, Nez Percés, and Kootenais, are
mentioned as neat and cleanly; the rest, though filthy,
are still somewhat superior to the dwellers on the coast.
The Flatheads wash themselves daily, but their dishes
and utensils never. De Smet represents the Pend d'Oreille
women as untidy even for savages.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Guns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
knives and tomahawks have generally taken the place
of such native weapons as these natives may have used
against their foes originally. Only the bow and arrow
have survived intercourse with white men, and no other
native weapon is described, except one peculiar to the
Okanagans,&mdash;a kind of Indian slung-shot. This is a
small cylindrical ruler of hard wood, covered with raw
hide, which at one end forms a small bag and holds a
round stone as large as a goose-egg; the other end of
the weapon is tied to the wrist. Arrow-shafts are of
hard wood, carefully straightened by rolling between
two blocks, fitted by means of sinews with stone or flint
heads at one end, and pinnated with feathers at the
other. The most elastic woods are chosen for the bow,
and its force is augmented by tendons glued to its
back.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE INLAND NATIONS AT WAR.</p>

<p>The inland families cannot be called a warlike race.
Resort to arms for the settlement of their intertribal
disputes seems to have been very rare. Yet all are
brave warriors when fighting becomes necessary for defense
or vengeance against a foreign foe; notably so the
Cayuses, Nez Percés, Flatheads and Kootenais. The
two former waged both aggressive and defensive warfare
against the Snakes of the south; while the latter
joined their arms against their common foes, the eastern
Blackfeet, who, though their inferiors in bravery, nearly
exterminated the Flathead nation by superiority in numbers,
and by being the first to obtain the white man's
weapons. Departure on a warlike expedition is always
preceded by ceremonious preparation, including councils
of the wise, great, and old; smoking the pipe, harangues
by the chiefs, dances, and a general review, or display of
equestrian feats and the man&oelig;uvres of battle. The warriors
are always mounted; in many tribes white or speckled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
war-horses are selected, and both rider and steed are
gaily painted, and decked with feathers, trinkets, and
bright-colored cloths. The war-party in most nations is
under the command of a chief periodically elected by
the tribe, who has no authority whatever in peace, but
who keeps his soldiers in the strictest discipline in time
of war. Stealthy approach and an unexpected attack
in the early morning constitute their favorite tactics.
They rush on the enemy like a whirlwind, with terrific
yells, discharge their guns or arrows, and retire to prepare
for another attack. The number slain is rarely
large; the fall of a few men, or the loss of a chief decides
the victory. When a man falls, a rush is made for
his scalp, which is defended by his party, and a fierce
hand-to-hand conflict ensues, generally terminating the
battle. After the fight, or before it when either party
lacks confidence in the result, a peace is made by smoking
the pipe, with the most solemn protestations of goodwill,
and promises which neither party has the slightest
intention of fulfilling. The dead having been scalped,
and prisoners bound and taken up behind the victors,
the party starts homeward. Torture of the prisoners,
chiefly perpetrated by the women, follows the arrival.
By the Flatheads and northern nations captives are generally
killed by their sufferings; among the Sahaptins
some survive and are made slaves. In the Flathead
torture of the Blackfeet are practiced all the fiendish
acts of cruelty that native cunning can devise, all of
which are borne with the traditional stoicism and taunts
of the North American Indian. The Nez Percé system
is a little less cruel in order to save life for future slavery.
Day after day, at a stated hour, the captives are brought
out and made to hold the scalps of their dead friends
aloft on poles while the scalp-dance is performed about
them, the female participators meanwhile exerting all
their devilish ingenuity in tormenting their victims.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>The native saddle consists of a rude wooden frame,
under and over which is thrown a buffalo-robe, and which
is bound to the horse by a very narrow thong of hide
in place of the Mexican <i>cincha</i>. A raw-hide crupper is
used; a deer-skin pad sometimes takes the place of the
upper robe, or the robe and pad are used without the
wooden frame. Stirrups are made by binding three
straight pieces of wood or bone together in triangular
form, and sometimes covering all with raw-hide put on
wet; or one straight piece is suspended from a forked
thong, and often the simple thong passing round the foot
suffices. The bridle is a rope of horse-hair or of skin,
made fast with a half hitch round the animal's lower
jaw. The same rope usually serves for bridle and lariat.
Sharp bones, at least in later times, are used for spurs.
Wood is split for the few native uses by elk-horn wedges
driven by bottle-shaped stone mallets. Baskets and vessels
for holding water and cooking are woven of willow,
bark, and grasses. Rushes, growing in all swampy localities
are cut of uniform length, laid parallel and tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
together for matting. Rude bowls and spoons are sometimes
dug out of horn or wood, but the fingers, with
pieces of bark and small mats are the ordinary table
furniture. Skins are dressed by spreading, scraping off
the flesh, and for some purposes the hair, with a sharp
piece of bone, stone, or iron attached to a short handle,
and used like an adze. The skin is then smeared with
the animal's brains, and rubbed or pounded by a very
tedious process till it becomes soft and white, some hides
being previously smoked and bleached with white clay.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PREPARATION OF SKINS. RIVER-BOATS.</p>

<p>On the lower Columbia the Wascos, Kliketats, Walla
Wallas, and other tribes use dug-out boats like those of
the coast, except that little skill or labor is expended on
their construction or ornamentation; the only requisite
being supporting capacity, as is natural in a country
where canoes play but a small part in the work of procuring
food. Farther in the interior the mountain tribes
of the Sahaptin family, as the Cayuses and Nez Percés,
make no boats, but use rude rafts or purchase an occasional
canoe from their neighbors, for the rare cases when
it becomes necessary to transport property across an unfordable
stream. The Flatheads sew up their lodge-skins
into a temporary boat for the same purpose. On the
Fraser the Nootka dug-out is in use. But on the northern
lakes and rivers of the interior, the Pend d'Oreille,
Flatbow, Arrow, and Okanagan, northward to the Tacully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
territory, the natives manufacture and navigate
bark canoes. Both birch and pine are employed, by
stretching it over a cedar hoop-work frame, sewing the
ends with fine roots, and gumming the seams and knots.
The form is very peculiar; the stem and stern are
pointed, but the points are on a level with the bottom
of the boat, and the slope or curve is upward towards
the centre. Travelers describe them as carrying a heavy
load, but easily capsized unless when very skillfully managed.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HORSES, PROPERTY, AND TRADE.</p>

<p>Horses constitute the native wealth, and poor indeed
is the family which has not for each member, young and
old, an animal to ride, as well as others sufficient to transport
all the household goods, and to trade for the few
foreign articles needed. The Nez Percés, Cayuses and
Walla Wallas have more and better stock than other
nations, individuals often possessing bands of from one
thousand to three thousand. The Kootenais are the
most northern equestrian tribes mentioned. How the
natives originally obtained horses is unknown, although
there are some slight traditions in support of the natural
supposition that they were first introduced from the
south by way of the Shoshones. The latter are one
people with the Comanches, by whom horses were obtained
during the Spanish expeditions to New Mexico
in the sixteenth century. The horses of the natives are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
of small size, probably degenerated from a superior stock,
but hardy and surefooted; sustaining hunger and hard
usage better than those of the whites, but inferior to them
in form, action, and endurance. All colors are met with,
spotted and mixed colors being especially prized.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>The different articles of food, skins and grasses for
clothing and lodges and implements, shells and trinkets
for ornamentation and currency are also bartered between
the nations, and the annual summer gatherings
on the rivers serve as fairs for the display and exchange
of commodities; some tribes even visit the coast for
purposes of trade. Smoking the pipe often precedes and
follows a trade, and some peculiar commercial customs
prevail, as for instance when a horse dies soon after
purchase, the price may be reclaimed. The rights of
property are jealously defended, but in the Salish nations,
according to Hale, on the death of a father his
relatives seize the most valuable property with very little
attention to the rights of children too young to look
out for their own interests.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Indeed, I have heard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
deeds of similar import in white races. In decorative
art the inland natives must be pronounced inferior to
those of the coast, perhaps only because they have less
time to devote to such unproductive labor. Sculpture
and painting are rare and exceedingly rude. On the
coast the passion for ornamentation finds vent in carving
and otherwise decorating the canoe, house, and implements;
in the interior it expends itself on the caparison
of the horse, or in bead and fringe work on garments.
Systems of numeration are simple, progressing by fours,
fives, or tens, according to the different languages, and is
sufficiently extensive to include large numbers; but the
native rarely has occasion to count beyond a few hundreds,
commonly using his fingers as an aid to his numeration.
Years are reckoned by winters, divided by
moons into months, and these months named from the
ripening of some plant, the occurrence of a fishing or
hunting season, or some other periodicity in their lives,
or by the temperature. Among the Salish the day is
divided according to the position of the sun into nine
parts. De Smet states that maps are made on bark or
skins by which to direct their course on distant excursions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
and that they are guided at night by the polar
star.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHIEFS AND THEIR AUTHORITY.</p>

<p>War chiefs are elected for their bravery and past success,
having full authority in all expeditions, marching
at the head of their forces, and, especially among the
Flatheads, maintaining the strictest discipline, even to
the extent of inflicting flagellation on insubordinates.
With the war their power ceases, yet they make no effort
by partiality during office to insure re-election, and submit
without complaint to a successor. Except by the
war chiefs no real authority is exercised. The regular
chieftainship is hereditary so far as any system is observed,
but chiefs who have raised themselves to their
position by their merits are mentioned among nearly
all the nations. The leaders are always men of commanding
influence and often of great intelligence. They
take the lead in haranguing at the councils of wise men,
which meet to smoke and deliberate on matters of public
moment. These councils decide the amount of fine necessary
to atone for murder, theft, and the few crimes
known to the native code; a fine, the chief's reprimand,
and rarely flogging, probably not of native origin, are
the only punishments; and the criminal seldom attempts
to escape. As the more warlike nations have especial
chiefs with real power in time of war, so the fishing
tribes, some of them, grant great authority to a 'salmon
chief' during the fishing-season. But the regular inland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
chiefs never collect taxes nor presume to interfere with
the rights or actions of individuals or families.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Prisoners
of war, not killed by torture, are made slaves, but
they are few in number, and their children are adopted
into the victorious tribe. Hereditary slavery and the
slave-trade are unknown. The Shushwaps are said to
have no slaves.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FAMILY RELATIONS.</p>

<p>In choosing a helpmate, or helpmates, for his bed and
board, the inland native makes capacity for work the
standard of female excellence, and having made a selection
buys a wife from her parents by the payment of
an amount of property, generally horses, which among
the southern nations must be equaled by the girl's parents.
Often a betrothal is made by parents while both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
parties are yet children, and such a contract, guaranteed
by an interchange of presents, is rarely broken. To
give away a wife without a price is in the highest degree
disgraceful to her family. Besides payment of the price,
generally made for the suitor by his friends, courtship
in some nations includes certain visits to the bride before
marriage; and the Spokane suitor must consult both the
chief and the young lady, as well as her parents; indeed
the latter may herself propose if she wishes. Runaway
matches are not unknown, but by the Nez Percés the
woman is in such cases considered a prostitute, and the
bride's parents may seize upon the man's property. Many
tribes seem to require no marriage ceremony, but in others
an assemblage of friends for smoking and feasting is
called for on such occasions; and among the Flatheads
more complicated ceremonies are mentioned, of which
long lectures to the couple, baths, change of clothing,
torch-light processions, and dancing form a part. In the
married state the wife must do all the heavy work and
drudgery, but is not otherwise ill treated, and in most
tribes her rights are equally respected with those of the
husband.</p>

<p class="sidenote">WOMEN AND CHILDREN.</p>

<p>When there are several wives each occupies a separate
lodge, or at least has a separate fire. Among the Spokanes
a man marrying out of his own tribe joins that of
his wife, because she can work better in a country to
which she is accustomed; and in the same nation all
household goods are considered as the wife's property.
The man who marries the eldest daughter is entitled to
all the rest, and parents make no objection to his turning
off one in another's favor. Either party may dissolve
the marriage at will, but property must be equitably
divided, the children going with the mother. Discarded
wives are often reinstated. If a Kliketat wife
die soon after marriage, the husband may reclaim her
price; the Nez Percé may not marry for a year after her
death, but he is careful to avoid the inconvenience of
this regulation by marrying just before that event. The
Salish widow must remain a widow for about two years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
and then must marry agreeably to her mother-in-law's
taste or forfeit her husband's property.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The women
make faithful, obedient wives and affectionate mothers.
Incontinence in either girls or married women is extremely
rare, and prostitution almost unknown, being
severely punished, especially among the Nez Percés. In
this respect the inland tribes present a marked contrast
to their coast neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> At the first appearance of
the menses the woman must retire from the sight of all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
especially men, for a period varying from ten days to a
month, and on each subsequent occasion for two or three
days, and must be purified by repeated ablutions before
she may resume her place in the household. Also at the
time of her confinement she is deemed unclean, and must
remain for a few weeks in a separate lodge, attended
generally by an old woman. The inland woman is not
prolific, and abortions are not uncommon, which may
probably be attributed in great measure to her life of
labor and exposure. Children are not weaned till between
one and two years of age; sometimes not until
they abandon the breast of their own accord or are supplanted
by a new arrival; yet though subsisting on the
mother's milk alone, and exposed with slight clothing to
all extremes of weather, they are healthy and robust,
being carried about in a rude cradle on the mother's
back, or mounted on colts and strapped to the saddle
that they may not fall off when asleep. After being
weaned the child is named after some animal, but the
name is changed frequently later in life.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Although
children and old people are as a rule kindly cared for,
yet so great the straits to which the tribes are reduced
by circumstances, that both are sometimes abandoned if
not put to death.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>

<p class="sidenote">GAMES IN THE INTERIOR.</p>

<p>The annual summer gathering on the river banks for
fishing and trade, and, among the mountain nations, the
return from a successful raid in the enemy's country, are
the favorite periods for native diversions.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> To gambling
they are no less passionately addicted in the interior
than on the coast,<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> but even in this universal Indian
vice, their preference for horse-racing, the noblest form
of gaming, raises them above their stick-shuffling brethren
of the Pacific. On the speed of his horse the native
stakes all he owns, and is discouraged only when his
animal is lost, and with it the opportunity to make up
past losses in another race. Foot-racing and target-shooting,
in which men, women and children participate,
also afford them indulgence in their gambling propensities
and at the same time develop their bodies by exercise,
and perfect their skill in the use of their native
weapon.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The Colvilles have a game, <i>alkollock</i>, played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
with spears. A wooden ring some three inches in diameter
is rolled over a level space between two slight stick
barriers about forty feet apart; when the ring strikes the
barrier the spear is hurled so that the ring will fall over
its head; and the number scored by the throw depends
on which of six colored beads, attached to the hoop's
inner circumference, falls over the spear's head.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The
almost universal Columbian game of guessing which hand
contains a small polished bit of bone or wood is also a
favorite here, and indeed the only game of the kind
mentioned; it is played, to the accompaniment of songs
and drumming, by parties sitting in a circle on mats, the
shuffler's hands being often wrapped in fur, the better to
deceive the players.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> All are excessively fond of dancing
and singing; but their songs and dances, practiced
on all possible occasions, have not been, if indeed they
can be, described. They seem merely a succession of
sounds and motions without any fixed system. Pounding
on rude drums of hide accompanies the songs, which
are sung without words, and in which some listeners have
detected a certain savage melody. Scalp-dances are performed
by women hideously painted, who execute their
diabolical antics in the centre of a circle formed by the
rest of the tribe who furnish music to the dancers.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
All are habitual smokers, always inhaling the smoke instead
of puffing it out after the manner of more civilized
devotees of the weed. To obtain tobacco the native will
part with almost any other property, but no mention is
made of any substitute used in this region before the
white man came. Besides his constant use of the pipe
as an amusement or habit, the inland native employs it
regularly to clear his brain for the transaction of important
business. Without the pipe no war is declared,
no peace officially ratified; in all promises and contracts
it serves as the native pledge of honor; with ceremonial
whiffs to the cardinal points the wise men open and
close the deliberations of their councils; a commercial
smoke clinches a bargain, as it also opens negotiations of
trade.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF HORSES.</p>

<p>The use of the horse has doubtless been a most
powerful agent in molding inland customs; and yet the
introduction of the horse must have been of comparatively
recent date. What were the customs and character
of these people, even when America was first discovered
by the Spaniards, must ever be unknown. It is by
no means certain that the possession of the horse has materially
bettered their condition. Indeed, by facilitating
the capture of buffalo, previously taken perhaps by stratagem,
by introducing a medium with which at least the
wealthy may always purchase supplies, as well as by rendering
practicable long migrations for food and trade, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
horse may have contributed somewhat to their present
spirit of improvidence. The horses feed in large droves,
each marked with some sign of ownership, generally by
clipping the ears, and when required for use are taken by
the lariat, in the use of which all the natives have some
skill, though far inferior to the Mexican <i>vaqueros</i>. The
method of breaking and training horses is a quick and
an effectual one. It consists of catching and tying the
animal; then buffalo-skins and other objects are thrown
at and upon the trembling beast, until all its fear is
frightened out of it. When willing to be handled,
horses are treated with great kindness, but when refractory,
the harshest measures are adopted. They are
well trained to the saddle, and accustomed to be mounted
from either side. They are never shod and never
taught to trot. The natives are skillful riders, so far as
the ability to keep their seat at great speed over a rough
country is concerned, but they never ride gracefully, and
rarely if ever perform the wonderful feats of horsemanship
so often attributed to the western Indians. A loose
girth is used under which to insert the knees when riding
a wild horse. They are hard riders, and horses in
use always have sore backs and mouths. Women ride
astride, and quite as well as the men; children also
learn to ride about as early as to walk.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Each nation
has its superstitions; by each individual is recognized
the influence of unseen powers, exercised usually through
the medium of his medicine animal chosen early in life.
The peculiar customs arising from this belief in the
supernatural are not very numerous or complicated, and
belong rather to the religion of these people treated elsewhere.
The Pend d'Oreille, on approaching manhood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
was sent by his father to a high mountain and obliged
to remain until he dreamed of some animal, bird, or fish,
thereafter to be his medicine, whose claw, tooth, or feather
was worn as a charm. The howling of the medicine-wolf
and some other beasts forebodes calamity, but by the
Okanagans the white-wolf skin is held as an emblem of
royalty, and its possession protects the horses of the
tribe from evil-minded wolves. A ram's horns left in
the trunk of a tree where they were fixed by the misdirected
zeal of their owner in attacking a native, were
much venerated by the Flatheads, and gave them power
over all animals so long as they made frequent offerings
at the foot of the tree. The Nez Percés had a peculiar
custom of overcoming the <i>mawish</i> or spirit of fatigue,
and thereby acquiring remarkable powers of endurance.
The ceremony is performed annually from the age of
eighteen to forty, lasts each time from three to seven
days, and consists of thrusting willow sticks down the
throat into the stomach, a succession of hot and cold
baths, and abstinence from food. Medicine-men acquire
or renew their wonderful powers by retiring to the
mountains to confer with the wolf. They are then invulnerable;
a bullet fired at them flattens on their breast.
To allowing their portraits to be taken, or to the operations
of strange apparatus they have the same aversion
that has been noted on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Steam baths are
universally used, not for motives of cleanliness, but sometimes
for medical purposes, and chiefly in their superstitious
ceremonies of purification. The bath-house is a
hole dug in the ground from three to eight feet deep,
and sometimes fifteen feet in diameter, in some locality
where wood and water are at hand, often in the river
bank. It is also built above ground of willow branches
covered with grass and earth. Only a small hole is left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
for entrance, and this is closed up after the bather enters.
Stones are heated by a fire in the bath itself, or
are thrown in after being heated outside. In this oven,
heated to a suffocating temperature, the naked native
revels for a long time in the steam and mud, meanwhile
singing, howling, praying, and finally rushes out
dripping with perspiration, to plunge into the nearest
stream.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Every lodge is surrounded by a pack of worthless
coyote-looking curs. These are sometimes made to
carry small burdens on their backs when the tribe is
moving; otherwise no use is made of them, as they are
never eaten, and, with perhaps the exception of a breed
owned by the Okanagans, are never trained to hunt. I
give in a note a few miscellaneous customs noticed by
travelers.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL PRACTICE.</p>

<p>These natives of the interior are a healthy but not a
very long-lived race. Ophthalmia, of which the sand,
smoke of the lodges, and reflection of the sun's rays on
the lakes are suggested as the causes, is more or less
prevalent throughout the territory; scrofulous complaints
and skin-eruptions are of frequent occurrence, especially
in the Sahaptin family. Other diseases are comparatively
rare, excepting of course epidemic disorders like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
small-pox and measles contracted from the whites, which
have caused great havoc in nearly all the tribes. Hot
and cold baths are the favorite native remedy for all
their ills, but other simple specifics, barks, herbs, and
gums are employed as well. Indeed, so efficacious is
their treatment, or rather, perhaps, so powerful with
them is nature in resisting disease, that when the locality
or cause of irregularity is manifest, as in the case
of wounds, fractures, or snake-bites, remarkable cures
are ascribed to these people. But here as elsewhere, the
sickness becoming at all serious or mysterious, medical
treatment proper is altogether abandoned, and the patient
committed to the magic powers of the medicine-man.
In his power either to cause or cure disease at
will implicit confidence is felt, and failure to heal indicates
no lack of skill; consequently the doctor is responsible
for his patient's recovery, and in case of death is
liable to, and often does, answer with his life, so that a
natural death among the medical fraternity is extremely
rare. His only chance of escape is to persuade relatives
of the dead that his ill success is attributable to the evil
influence of a rival physician, who is the one to die; or
in some cases a heavy ransom soothes the grief of mourning
friends and avengers. One motive of the Cayuses
in the massacre of the Whitman family is supposed to
have been the missionary's failure to cure the measles in
the tribe. He had done his best to relieve the sick, and
his power to effect in all cases a complete cure was unquestioned
by the natives. The methods by which the
medicine-man practices his art are very uniform in all
the nations. The patient is stretched on his back in the
centre of a large lodge, and his friends few or many sit
about him in a circle, each provided with sticks wherewith
to drum. The sorcerer, often grotesquely painted,
enters the ring, chants a song, and proceeds to force the
evil spirit from the sick man by pressing both clenched
fists with all his might in the pit of his stomach, kneading
and pounding also other parts of the body, blowing
occasionally through his own fingers, and sucking blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
from the part supposed to be affected. The spectators
pound with their sticks, and all, including doctor, and
often the patient in spite of himself, keep up a continual
song or yell. There is, however, some method in this
madness, and when the routine is completed it is again
begun, and thus repeated for several hours each day until
the case is decided. In many nations the doctor
finally extracts the spirit, in the form of a small bone or
other object, from the patient's body or mouth by some
trick of legerdemain, and this once effected, he assures
the surrounding friends that the tormentor having been
thus removed, recovery must soon follow.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>Grief at the death of a relative is manifested by cutting
the hair and smearing the face with black. The
women also howl at intervals for a period of weeks or
even months; but the men on ordinary occasions rarely
make open demonstrations of sorrow, though they sometimes
shed tears at the death of a son. Several instances
of suicide in mourning are recorded; a Walla Walla
chieftain caused himself to be buried alive in the grave
with the last of his five sons. The death of a wife or
daughter is deemed of comparatively little consequence.
In case of a tribal disaster, as the death of a prominent
chief, or the killing of a band of warriors by a hostile
tribe, all indulge in the most frantic demonstrations,
tearing the hair, lacerating the flesh with flints, often inflicting
serious injury. The sacrifice of human life, generally
that of a slave, was practiced, but apparently nowhere
as a regular part of the funeral rites. Among the
Flatheads the bravest of the men and women ceremonially
bewail the loss of a warrior by cutting out pieces
of their own flesh and casting them with roots and other
articles into the fire. A long time passes before a dead
person's name is willingly spoken in the tribe. The
corpse is commonly disposed of by wrapping in ordinary
clothing and burying in the ground without a
coffin. The northern tribes sometimes suspended the
body in a canoe from a tree, while those in the south
formerly piled their dead in wooden sheds or sepulchres
above ground. The Okanagans often bound the body
upright to the trunk of a tree. Property was in all
cases sacrificed; horses usually, and slaves sometimes,
killed on the grave. The more valuable articles of wealth
were deposited with the body; the rest suspended on
poles over and about the grave or left on the surface of
the ground; always previously damaged in such manner
as not to tempt the sacrilegious thief, for their places of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
burial are held most sacred. Mounds of stones surmounted
with crosses indicate in later times the conversion
of the natives to a foreign religion.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">INLAND MORALITY.</p>

<p>In character and in morals,<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> as well as in physique, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
inland native is almost unanimously pronounced superior
to the dweller on the coast. The excitement of the
chase, of war, and of athletic sports ennobles the mind
as it develops the body; and although probably not by
nature less indolent than their western neighbors, yet
are these natives of the interior driven by circumstances
to habits of industry, and have much less leisure time
for the cultivation of the lower forms of vice. As a
race, and compared with the average American aborigines,
they are honest, intelligent, and pure in morals.
Travelers are liable to form their estimate of national
character from a view, perhaps unfair and prejudiced,
of the actions of a few individuals encountered; consequently
qualities the best and the worst have been given
by some to each of the nations now under consideration.
For the best reputation the Nez Percés, Flatheads and
Kootenais have always been rivals; their good qualities
have been praised by all, priest, trader and tourist.
Honest, just, and often charitable; ordinarily cold and
reserved, but on occasions social and almost gay; quick-tempered
and revengeful under what they consider injustice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
but readily appeased by kind treatment; cruel
only to captive enemies, stoical in the endurance of torture;
devotedly attached to home and family; these
natives probably come as near as it is permitted to flesh-and-blood
savages to the traditional noble red man of
the forest, sometimes met in romance. It is the pride
and boast of the Flathead that his tribe has never shed
the blood of a white man. Yet none, whatever their
tribe, could altogether resist the temptation to steal
horses from their neighbors of a different tribe, or in
former times, to pilfer small articles, wonderful to the
savage eye, introduced by Europeans. Many have been
nominally converted by the zealous labors of the Jesuit
fathers, or Protestant missionaries; and several nations
have greatly improved, in material condition as well
as in character, under their change of faith. As Mr
Alexander Ross remarks, "there is less crime in an
Indian camp of five hundred souls than there is in a
civilized village of but half that number. Let the
lawyer or moralist point out the cause."

of the Columbia Valley up to the Dalles, and belonged originally to a small
tribe on the north bank near the mouth. 'The nation, or rather family, to
which the generic name of Chinook has attached, formerly inhabited both
banks of the Columbia River, from its mouth to the Grand Dalles, a distance
of about a hundred and seventy miles.' 'On the north side of the river, first
the Chinooks proper (Tchi-nuk), whose territory extended from Cape Disappointment

<p class="sidenote">NATIVES OF THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY.</p>

<p>Willamette Valley Nations: 'The nations who inhabit this fertile neighbourhood
are very numerous. The Wappatoo inlet extends three hundred
yards wide, for ten or twelve miles to the south, as far as the hills near
which it receives the waters of a small creek, whose sources are not far from
those of the Killamuck river. On that creek resides the Clackstar nation, a
numerous people of twelve hundred souls, who subsist on fish and wappatoo,
and who trade by means of the Killamuck river, with the nation of that
name on the sea-coast. Lower down the inlet, towards the Columbia, is the
tribe called Cathlacumup. On the sluice which connects the inlet with the
Multnomah, are the tribes Cathlanahquiah and Cathlacomatup; and on Wappatoo
island, the tribes of Clannahminamun and Clahnaquah. Immediately
opposite, near the Towahnahiooks, are the Quathlapotles, and higher
up, on the side of the Columbia, the Shotos. All these tribes, as well as
the Cathlahaws, who live somewhat lower on the river, and have an old village
on Deer island, may be considered as parts of the great Multnomah
nation, which has its principal residence on Wappatoo island, near the mouth
of the large river to which they give their name. Forty miles above its junction
with the Columbia, it receives the waters of the Clackamos, a river which
may be traced through a woody and fertile country to its sources in Mount
Jefferson, almost to the foot of which it is navigable for canoes. A nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
of the same name resides in eleven villages along its borders: they live chiefly
on fish and roots, which abound in the Clackamos and along its banks, though
they sometimes descend to the Columbia to gather wappatoo, where they cannot
be distinguished by dress or manners, or language, from the tribes of
Multnomahs. Two days' journey from the Columbia, or about twenty miles
beyond the entrance of the Clackamos, are the falls of the Multnomah. At
this place are the permanent residences of the Cushooks and Chaheowahs,
two tribes who are attracted to that place by the fish, and by the convenience
of trading across the mountains and down Killamuck river, with the nation
of Killamucks, from whom they procure train oil. These falls were occasioned
by the passage of a high range of mountains; beyond which the
country stretches into a vast level plain, wholly destitute of timber. As far
as the Indians, with whom we conversed, had ever penetrated that country,
it was inhabited by a nation called Calahpoewah, a very numerous people,
whose villages, nearly forty in number, are scattered along each side of the
Multnomah, which furnish them with their chief subsistence, fish, and the
roots along its banks.' <i>Lewis and Clarke's Trav.</i>, pp. 507-8. Calapooyas, Moolallels,

<span class="s08">CALIFORNIANS.</span></h3>

<p class="ch_summ">
<span class="smcap">Groupal Divisions; Northern, Central, and Southern Californians, and

<p>Of the seven groups into which this work separates the
nations of western North America, the <span class="smcap">Californians</span> constitute
the third, and cover the territory between latitude
43° and 32° 30´, extending back irregularly into the
Rocky Mountains. There being few distinctly marked
families in this group, I cannot do better in subdividing
it for the purpose of description than make of the
Californians proper three geographical divisions, namely,
the <i>Northern Californians</i>, the <i>Central Californians</i>, and
the <i>Southern Californians</i>. The <i>Shoshones</i>, or fourth division
of this group, who spread out over south-eastern
Oregon, southern Idaho, and the whole of Nevada and
Utah, present more distinctly marked family characteristics,
and will therefore be treated as a family.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HOME OF THE CALIFORNIANS.</p>

<p>The same chain of mountains, which, as the Cascade
Range, divides the land of the Columbians, holds its
course steadily southward, and entering the territory of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the Californian group forms, under the name of the Sierra
Nevada, the partition between the Californians proper
and the Shoshones of Idaho and Nevada. The influence
of this range upon the climate is also here manifest, only
intenser in degree than farther north. The lands of the
Northern Californians are well watered and wooded,
those of the central division have an abundance of water
for six months in the year, namely, from November to
May, and the soil is fertile, yielding abundantly under
cultivation. Sycamore, oak, cotton-wood, willow, and
white alder, fringe the banks of the rivers; laurel, buckeye,
manzanita, and innumerable berry-bearing bushes,
clothe the lesser hills; thousands of acres are annually
covered with wild oats; the moist bottoms yield heavy
crops of grass; and in summer the valleys are gorgeous
with wild-flowers of every hue. Before the blighting
touch of the white man was laid upon the land, the
rivers swarmed with salmon and trout; deer, antelope,
and mountain sheep roamed over the foot-hills,
bear and other carnivora occupied the forests, and
numberless wild fowl covered the lakes. Decreasing in
moisture toward the tropics, the climate of the Southern
Californians is warm and dry, while the Shoshones, a
large part of whose territory falls in the Great Basin, are
cursed with a yet greater dryness.</p>

<p>The region known as the Great Basin, lying between
the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada and the Wahsatch
Mountains, and stretching north and south from latitude
33° to 42°, presents a very different picture from the land
of the Californians. This district is triangular in shape,
the apex pointing toward the south, or southwest; from
this apex, which, round the head of the Gulf of California,
is at tide level, the ground gradually rises until, in
central Nevada, it reaches an altitude of about five thousand
feet, and this, with the exception of a few local depressions,
is about the level of the whole of the broad
part of the basin. The entire surface of this plateau is
alkaline. Being in parts almost destitute of water, there
is comparatively little timber; sage-brush and greasewood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
being the chief signs of vegetation, except at rare intervals
where some small stream struggling against almost
universal aridity, supports on its banks a little scanty
herbage and a few forlorn-looking cotton-wood trees.
The northern part of this region, as is the case with the
lands of the Californians proper, is somewhat less destitute
of vegetable and animal life than the southern
portion which is indeed a desert occupied chiefly by rabbits,
prairie-dogs, sage-hens, and reptiles. The desert of
the Colorado, once perhaps a fertile bottom, extending
northward from the San Bernardino Mountains one
hundred and eighty miles, and spreading over an area of
about nine thousand square miles, is a silent unbroken
sea of sand, upon whose ashy surface glares the mid-day
sun and where at night the stars draw near through the
thin air and brilliantly illumine the eternal solitude.
Here the gigantic cereus, emblem of barrenness, rears its
contorted form, casting weird shadows upon the moonlit
level. In such a country, where in winter the keen
dust-bearing blast rushes over the unbroken desolate
plains, and in summer the very earth cracks open with
intense heat, what can we expect of man but that he
should be distinguished for the depths of his low attainment.</p>

<p>But although the poverty and barrenness of his
country account satisfactorily for the low type of the
inhabitant of the Great Basin, yet no such excuse is
offered for the degradation of the native of fertile California.
On every side, if we except the Shoshone, in
regions possessing far fewer advantages than California,
we find a higher type of man. Among the Tuscaroras,
Cherokees, and Iroquois of the Atlantic slope, barbarism
assumes its grandest proportions; proceeding west it
bursts its fetters in the incipient civilization of the Gila;
but if we continue the line to the shores of the Pacific we
find this intellectual dawn checked, and man sunk almost
to the utter darkness of the brute. Coming southward from
the frozen land of the Eskimo, or northward from tropical
Darien we pass through nations possessing the necessaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
and even the comforts of life. Some of them raise
and grind wheat and corn, many of them make pottery
and other utensils, at the north they venture out to sea
in good boats and make Behemoth their spoil. The
Californians on the other hand, comparatively speaking,
wear no clothes, they build no houses, do not cultivate
the soil, they have no boats, nor do they hunt to any considerable
extent; they have no morals nor any religion
worth calling such. The missionary Fathers found a
virgin field whereon neither god nor devil was worshiped.
We must look, then, to other causes for a solution of the
question why a nobler race is not found in California;
such for instance as revolutions and migrations of nations,
or upheavals and convulsions of nature, causes arising
before the commencement of the short period within
which we are accustomed to reckon time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TRIBAL DIVERSITY.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, a greater diversity of tribal names
among the Californians than elsewhere in America; the
whole system of nomenclature is so complicated and contradictory
that it is impossible to reduce it to perfect
order. There are tribes that call themselves by one
name, but whose neighbors call them by another; tribes
that are known by three or four names, and tribes that
have no name except that of their village or chief.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
Tribal names are frequently given by one writer which
are never mentioned by any other;<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> nevertheless there
are tribes on whose names authorities agree, and though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the spelling differs, the sound expressed in these instances
is about the same. Less trouble is experienced in distinguishing
the tribes of the northern division, which
is composed of people who resemble their neighbors more
than is the case in central California, where the meaningless
term 'Indians,' is almost universally applied in
speaking of them.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Another fruitful source of confusion is the indefinite
nickname 'Digger' which is applied indiscriminately to
all the tribes of northern and middle California, and to
those of Nevada, Utah, and the southern part of Oregon.
These tribes are popularly known as the Californian
Diggers, Washoe Diggers, Shoshone Diggers of Utah, etc.,
the signification of the term pointing to the digging of roots,
and in some parts, possibly, to burrowing in the ground.
The name is seemingly opprobrious, and is certainly no
more applicable to this people than to many others. By
this territorial division I hope to avoid, as far as possible,
the two causes of bewilderment before alluded to; neither
treating the inhabitants of an immense country as one
tribe, nor attempting to ascribe distinct names and idiosyncrasies
to hundreds of small, insignificant bands,
roaming over a comparatively narrow area of country
and to all of which one description will apply.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NATIONS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Northern Californians</span>, the first tribal group,
or division, of which I shall speak, might, not improperly,
be called the Klamath family, extending as they
do from Rogue River on the north, to the Eel River
south, and from the Pacific Ocean to the Californian
boundary east, and including the Upper and Lower Klamath
and other lakes. The principal tribes occupying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
this region are the <i>Klamaths</i>,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> who live on the headwaters
of the river and on the shores of the lake of that
name; the <i>Modocs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> on Lower Klamath Lake and along
Lost River; the <i>Shastas</i>, to the south-west of the lakes,
near the Shasta Mountains; the <i>Pitt River Indians</i>; the
<i>Eurocs</i> on the Klamath River between Weitspek and the
coast; the <i>Cahrocs</i><a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> on the Klamath River from a short
distance above the junction of the Trinity to the Klamath
Mountains; the <i>Hoopahs</i> in Hoopah Valley on the
Trinity near its junction with the Klamath; numerous
tribes on the coast from Eel River and Humboldt Bay
north, such as the <i>Weeyots</i>,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> <i>Wallies</i>, <i>Tolewahs</i>, etc., and
the <i>Rogue River Indians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> on and about the river of that
name.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The Northern Californians are in every way superior
to the central and southern tribes.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Their physique and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
character, in fact, approach nearer to the Oregon nations
than to the people of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys. This applies more particularly to the inland
tribes. The race gradually deteriorates as it approaches
the coast, growing less in stature, darker in color, more
and more degraded in character, habits, and religion.
The Rogue River Indians must, however, be made an
exception to this rule. The tendency to improve toward
the north, which is so marked among the Californians,
holds good in this case; so that the natives on the extreme
north-west coast of the region under consideration,
are in many respects superior to the interior but more
southerly tribes.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL PECULIARITIES.</p>

<p>The Northern Californians round the Klamath lakes,
and the Klamath, Trinity, and Rogue rivers, are tall,
muscular, and well made,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> with a complexion varying
from nearly black to light brown, in proportion to their
proximity to, or distance, from the ocean or other large
bodies of water; their face is large, oval, and heavily
made, with slightly prominent cheek-bones, nose well
set on the face and frequently straight, and eyes
which, when not blurred by ophthalmia, are keen and
bright. The women are short and some of them quite
handsome, even in the Caucasian sense of the word;<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
and although their beauty rapidly fades, yet they do
not in old age present that unnaturally wrinkled and
shriveled appearance, characteristic of the Central Californians.
This description scarcely applies to the people
inhabiting the coast about Redwood Creek, Humboldt
Bay, and Eel River, who are squat and fat in figure,
rather stoutly built, with large heads covered with coarse
thick hair, and repulsive countenances, who are of a
much darker color, and altogether of a lower type than
the tribes to the east and north of them.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Dress depends more on the state of the climate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
than on their own sense of decency. The men wear
a belt, sometimes a breech-clout, and the women an
apron or skirt of deer-skin or braided grass; then
they sometimes throw over the shoulders a sort of
cloak, or robe, of marten or rabbit skins sewn together,
deer-skin, or, among the coast tribes, seal or sea-otter skin.
When they indulge in this luxury, however, the men
usually dispense with all other covering.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Occasionally
we find them taking great pride in their gala dresses and
sparing no pains to render them beautiful. The Modocs,
for instance, took large-sized skins, and inlaid them with
brilliant-colored duck-scalps, sewed on in various figures;
others, again, embroidered their aprons with colored
grasses, and attached beads and shells to a deep fringe
falling from the lower part.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> A bowl-shaped hat, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
cap, of basket-work, is usually worn by the women, in
making which some of them are very skillful. This hat
is sometimes painted with various figures, and sometimes
interwoven with gay feathers of the woodpecker or blue
quail.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The men generally go bare-headed, their thick
hair being sufficient protection from sun and weather.
In the vicinity of the lakes, where, from living constantly
among the long grass and reeds, the greatest skill is
acquired in weaving and braiding, moccasins of straw or
grass are worn.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> At the junction of the Klamath and
Trinity rivers their moccasins have soles of several thicknesses
of leather.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The natives seen by Maurelle at Trinidad
Bay, bound their loins and legs down to the ankle
with strips of hide or thread, both men and women.</p>

<p>The manner of dressing the hair varies; the most
common way being to club it together behind in a queue,
sometimes in two, worn down the back, or occasionally
in the latter case drawn forward over the shoulders.
The queue is frequently twisted up in a knot on the back
of the head&mdash;<i>en castanna</i>&mdash;as Maurelle calls it. Occasionally
the hair is worn loose, and flowing, and some of
the women cut it short on the forehead. It is not uncommon
to see wreaths of oak or laurel leaves, feathers,
or the tails of gray squirrels twisted in the hair; indeed,
from the trouble which they frequently take to adorn
their coiffure, one would imagine that these people were
of a somewhat æsthetic turn of mind, but a closer acquaintance
quickly dispels the illusion. On Eel River
some cut all the hair short, a custom practiced to some
extent by the Central Californians.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FACIAL ORNAMENTATION.</p>

<p>As usual these savages are beardless, or nearly so.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
Tattooing, though not carried to any great extent, is
universal among the women, and much practiced by the
men, the latter confining this ornamentation to the breast
and arms. The women tattoo in three blue lines, extending
perpendicularly from the centre and corners of
the lower lip to the chin. In some tribes they tattoo
the arms, and occasionally the back of the hands. As
they grow older the lines on the chin, which at first are
very faint, are increased in width and color, thus gradually
narrowing the intervening spaces. Now, as the
social importance of the female is gauged by the width
and depth of color of these lines, one might imagine
that before long the whole chin would be what Southey
calls "blue, darkly, deeply, beautifully blue;" but fashion
ordains, as in the lip-ornament of the Thlinkeets, that
the lines should be materially enlarged only as the
charms of youth fade, thus therewith gauging both age
and respectability.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> In some few tribes, more especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
in the vicinity of the lakes, the men paint themselves
in various colors and grotesque patterns. Among the
Modocs the women also paint. Miller says that when a
Modoc warrior paints his face black before going into
battle it means victory or death, and he will not survive
a defeat.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Both men and women pierce the dividing
cartilage of the nose, and wear various kinds of ornaments
in the aperture. Sometimes it is a goose-quill,
three or four inches long, at others, a string of beads or
shells. Some of the more northerly tribes wear large
round pieces of wood or metal in the ears.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Maurelle,
in his bucolic description of the natives at Trinidad bay,
says that "on their necks they wear various fruits, instead
of beads."<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Vancouver, who visited the same
place nearly twenty years later, states that "all the teeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
of both sexes were by some process ground uniformly
down horizontally to the gums, the women especially,
carrying the fashion to an extreme, had their teeth reduced
even below this level."<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>Here also we see in their habitations the usual summer
and winter residences common to nomadic tribes.
The winter dwellings, varying with locality, are principally
of two forms&mdash;conical and square. Those of the
former shape, which is the most widely prevailing, and
obtains chiefly in the vicinity of the Klamath lakes and
on the Klamath and Trinity rivers, are built in the manner
following: A circular hole, from two to five feet in
depth, and varying in diameter, is dug in the ground.
Round this pit, or cellar, stout poles are sunk, which
are drawn together at the top until they nearly meet;
the whole is then covered with earth to the depth of
several inches. A hole is left in the top, which serves
as chimney and door, a rude ladder or notched pole communicating
with the cellar below, and a similar one with
the ground outside. This, however, is only the commoner
and lighter kind of conical house. Many of
them are built of much heavier timbers, which, instead
of being bent over at the top, and so forming a bee-hive-shaped
structure, are leaned one against the other.</p>

<p>The dwellings built by the Hoopahs are somewhat better.
The inside of the cellar is walled up with stone;
round this, and at a distance of a few feet from it, another
stone wall is built on the surface level, against
which heavy beams or split logs are leaned up, meeting
at the top, or sometimes the lower ends of the poles rest
against the inside of the wall, thus insuring the inmates
against a sudden collapse of the hut.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CALIFORNIAN HABITATIONS.</p>

<p>The square style of dwelling is affected more by the
coast tribes, although occasionally seen in the interior.
A cellar, either square or round, is dug in the same
manner as with the conical houses. The sides of the
hole are walled with upright slabs, which project some
feet above the surface of the ground. The whole structure
is covered with a roof of sticks or planks, sloping
gently outward, and resting upon a ridge-pole. The
position of the door varies, being sometimes in the roof,
sometimes on a level with the ground, and occasionally
high up in the gable. Its shape and dimensions, however,
never alter; it is always circular, barely large
enough to admit a full-grown man on hands and knees.
When on the roof or in the gable, a notched pole or
mud steps lead up to the entrance; when on the ground,
a sliding panel closes the entrance. In some cases, the
excavation is planked up only to a level with the ground.
The upper part is then raised several feet from the sides,
leaving a bank, or rim, on which the inmates sleep; occasionally
there is no excavation, the house being erected
on the level ground, with merely a small fire-hole in the
centre. The floors are kept smooth and clean, and a
small space in front of the door, paved with stones and
swept clean, serves as gossiping and working ground for
the women.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>The temporary summer houses of the Northern Californians
are square, conical, and inverted-bowl-shaped
huts; built, when square, by driving light poles into the
ground and laying others horizontally across them; when
conical, the poles are drawn together at the top into a
point; when bowl-shaped, both ends of the poles are
driven into the ground, making a semi-circular hut.
These frames, however shaped, are covered with neatly
woven tule matting,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> or with bushes or ferns.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HUNTING AND FISHING.</p>

<p>The Californians are but poor hunters; they prefer
the snare to the bow and arrow. Yet some of the mountain
tribes display considerable dexterity in the chase.
To hunt the prong-buck, the Klamath fastens to each
heel a strip of ermine-skin, and keeping the herd to the
windward, he approaches craftily through the tall grass
as near as possible, then throwing himself on his back,
or standing on his head, he executes a pantomime in the
air with his legs. Naturally the antelope wonder, and
being cursed with curiosity, the simple animals gradually
approach. As soon as they arrive within easy shooting-distance,
down go the hunter's legs and up comes the
body. Too late the antelope learn their mistake; swift
as they are, the arrow is swifter; and the fattest buck
pays the penalty of his inquisitiveness with his life.
The Veeards, at Humboldt Bay, construct a slight fence
from tree to tree, into which inclosure elk are driven,
the only exit being by a narrow opening at one end,
where a pole is placed in such a manner as to force the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
animal to stoop in passing under it, when its head is
caught in a noose suspended from the pole. This pole is
dragged down by the entangled elk, but soon he is caught
fast in the thick undergrowth, and firmly held until the
hunter comes up.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Pitfalls are also extensively used in
trapping game. A narrow pass, through which an elk
or deer trail leads, is selected for the pit, which is ten or
twelve feet deep. The animals are then suddenly stampeded
from their feeding-grounds, and, in their wild
terror, rush blindly along the trail to destruction.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The
bear they seldom hunt, and if one is taken, it is usually
by accident, in one of their strong elk-traps. Many of
the tribes refuse to eat bear-meat, alleging that the flesh
of a man-eating animal is unclean; but no doubt Bruin
owes his immunity as much to his teeth and claws as to
his uncleanness.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FISHING BY NIGHT ON THE KLAMATH.</p>

<p>Fishing is more congenial to the lazy taste of these
people than the nobler but more arduous craft of hunting;
consequently fish, being abundant, are generally more
plentiful in the aboriginal larder than venison. Several
methods are adopted in taking them. Sometimes a dam
of interwoven willows is constructed across a rapid at
the time when salmon are ascending the river; niches
four or five feet square are made at intervals across the
dam, in which the fish, pressed on by those behind,
collect in great numbers and are there speared or netted
without mercy. Much ingenuity and labor are required
to build some of the larger of these dams. Mr Gibbs
describes one thrown across the Klamath, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
river was about seventy-five yards wide, elbowing up
the stream in its deepest part. It was built by first
driving stout posts into the bed of the river, at a distance
of some two feet apart, having a moderate slope,
and supported from below, at intervals of ten or twelve
feet, by two braces; the one coming to the surface of the
water, the other reaching to the string-pieces. These
last were heavy spars, about thirty feet in length, and
secured to each post by withes. The whole dam was
faced with twigs, carefully peeled, and placed so close
together as to prevent the fish from passing up. The
top, at this stage of the water, was two or three feet
above the surface. The labor of constructing this work
must, with the few and insufficient tools of the natives,
have been immense. Slight scaffolds were built out below
it, from which the fish were taken in scoop-nets;
they also employ drag-nets and spears, the latter having
a movable barb, which is fastened to the shaft with a
string in order to afford the salmon play.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> On Rogue
River, spearing by torch-light&mdash;a most picturesque sight&mdash;is
resorted to. Twenty canoes sometimes start out
together, each carrying three persons&mdash;two women, one
to row and the other to hold the torch, and a spearman.
Sometimes the canoes move in concert, sometimes independently
of each other; one moment the lights are
seen in line, like an army of fire-flies, then they are
scattered over the dark surface of the water like ignes
fatui. The fish, attracted by the glare, rise to the surface,
where they are transfixed by the unerring aim of
the spearmen. Torchlight spearing is also done by driving
the fish down stream in the day-time by dint of
much wading, yelling, and howling, and many splashes,
until they are stopped by a dam previously erected lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
down; another dam is then built above, so that the fish
cannot escape. At night fires are built round the edge
of the enclosed space, and the finny game speared from
the bank.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Some tribes on the Klamath erect platforms
over the stream on upright poles, on which they sleep
and fish at the same time. A string leads from the net
either to the fisherman himself or to some kind of alarm;
and as soon as a salmon is caught, its floundering immediately
awakens the slumberer. On the sea-shore
smelts are taken in a triangular net stretched on two
slender poles; the fisherman wades into the water up to
his waist, turns his face to the shore, and his back to the
incoming waves, against whose force he braces himself
with a stout stick, then as the smelts are washed back
from the beach by the returning waves, he receives them
in his net. The net is deep, and a narrow neck connects
it with a long network bag behind; into this bag
the fish drop when the net is raised, but they cannot
return. In this manner the fisherman can remain for
some time at his post, without unloading.</p>

<p>Eels are caught in traps having a funnel-shaped entrance,
into which the eels can easily go, but which closes
on them as soon as they are in. These traps are fastened
to stakes and kept down by weights. Similar traps are
used to take salmon.</p>

<p>When preserved for winter use, the fish are split open
at the back, the bone taken out, then dried or smoked.
Both fish and meat, when eaten fresh, are either broiled
on hot stones or boiled in water-tight baskets, hot stones
being thrown in to make the water boil. Bread is made
of acorns ground to flour in a rough stone mortar with
a heavy stone pestle, and baked in the ashes. Acorn-flour
is the principal ingredient, but berries of various
kinds are usually mixed in, and frequently it is seasoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
with some high-flavored herb. A sort of pudding is
also made in the same manner, but is boiled instead of
baked.</p>

<p>They gather a great variety of roots, berries, and seeds.
The principal root is the camas,<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> great quantities of
which are dried every summer, and stored away for winter
provision. Another root, called <i>kice</i>, or <i>kace</i>,<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> is much
sought after. Of seeds they have the <i>wocus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> and several
varieties of grass-seeds. Among berries the huckleberry
and the manzanita berry are the most plentiful.<a name="FNanchor_459a" id="FNanchor_459a" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
The women do the cooking, root and berry gathering,
and all the drudgery.</p>

<p>The winter stock of smoked fish hangs in the family
room, sending forth an ancient and fish-like smell.
Roots and seeds are, among some of the more northerly
tribes, stored in large wicker boxes, built in the lower
branches of strong, wide-spreading trees. The trunk of
the tree below the granary is smeared with pitch to keep
away vermin.<a name="FNanchor_459b" id="FNanchor_459b" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The Modocs are sometimes obliged to
cache their winter hoard under rocks and bushes; the
great number of their enemies and bad character of
their ostensibly friendly neighbors, rendering it unsafe
for them to store it in their villages. So cunningly do
they conceal their treasure that one winter, after an unusually
heavy fall of snow, they themselves could not
find it, and numbers starved in consequence.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Although the Northern Californians seldom fail to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
take a cold bath in the morning, and frequently bathe
at intervals during the day, yet they are never clean.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR AND WEAPONS.</p>

<p>The Northern Californians are not of a very warlike
disposition, hence their weapons are few, being
confined chiefly to the bow and arrow.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The bow
is about three feet in length, made of yew, cedar, or
some other tough or elastic wood, and generally painted.
The back is flat, from an inch and a half to two inches
wide, and covered with elk-sinews, which greatly add
both to its strength and elasticity; the string is also of
sinew. The bow is held horizontally when discharged,
instead of perpendicularly as in most countries. The
arrows are from two to three feet long, and are made
sometimes of reed, sometimes of light wood. The points,
which are of flint, obsidian, bone, iron, or copper, are
ground to a very fine point, fastened firmly into a short
piece of wood, and fitted into a socket in the main shaft,
so that on withdrawing the arrow the head will be left
in the wound. The feathered part, which is from five
to eight inches long, is also sometimes a separate piece
bound on with sinews. The quiver is made of the skin
of a fox, wild-cat, or some other small animal, in the
same shape as when the animal wore it, except at the
tail end, where room is left for the feathered ends of
arrows to project. It is usually carried on the arm.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Powers says: "doubtless many persons who have
seen the flint arrow-heads made by the Indians, have
wondered how they succeeded with their rude implements,
in trimming them down to such sharp, thin points,
without breaking them to pieces. The Veeards&mdash;and
probably other tribes do likewise&mdash;employ for this purpose
a pair of buck-horn pincers, tied together at the
point with a thong. They first hammer out the arrow-head
in the rough, and then with these pincers carefully
nip off one tiny fragment after another, using that infinite
patience which is characteristic of the Indian,
spending days, perhaps weeks, on one piece. There are
Indians who make arrows as a specialty, just as there
are others who concoct herbs and roots for the healing
of men."<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The Shastas especially excelled in making obsidian
arrow-heads; Mr Wilkes of the Exploring Expedition
notices them as being "beautifully wrought," and
Lyon, in a letter to the American Ethnological Society,
communicated through Dr E. H. Davis, describes the
very remarkable ingenuity and skill which they display
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
in this particular. The arrow-point maker, who is one
of a regular guild, places the obsidian pebble upon an
anvil of talcose slate and splits it with an agate chisel
to the required size; then holding the piece with his
finger and thumb against the anvil, he finishes it off
with repeated slight blows, administered with marvelous
adroitness and judgment. One of these artists made
an arrow-point for Mr Lyon out of a piece of a broken
porter-bottle. Owing to his not being acquainted with
the grain of the glass, he failed twice, but the third time
produced a perfect specimen.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The Wallies poison their
arrows with rattlesnake-virus, but poisoned weapons seem
to be the exception.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The bow is skilfully used; war-clubs
are not common.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR AND ITS MOTIVES.</p>

<p>Wars, though of frequent occurrence, were not particularly
bloody. The casus belli was usually that which
brought the Spartan King before the walls of Ilion, and
Titus Tatius to incipient Rome&mdash;woman. It is true, the
Northern Californians are less classic abductors than the
spoilers of the Sabine women, but their wars ended in
the same manner&mdash;the ravished fair cleaving to her
warrior-lover. Religion also, that ever-fruitful source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
of war, is not without its conflicts in savagedom; thus
more than once the Shastas and the Umpquas have taken
up arms because of wicked sorceries, which caused the
death of the people.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> So when one people obstructed
the river with their weir, thereby preventing the ascent
of salmon, there was nothing left for those above but to
fight or starve.</p>

<p>Along Pitt River, pits from ten to fifteen feet deep
were formerly dug, in which the natives caught man and
beast. These man-traps, for such was their primary
use, were small at the mouth, widening toward the bottom,
so that exit was impossible, even were the victim
to escape impalement upon sharpened elk and deer horns,
which were favorably placed for his reception. The
opening was craftily concealed by means of light sticks,
over which earth was scattered, and the better to deceive
the unwary traveler, footprints were frequently stamped
with a moccasin in the loose soil. Certain landmarks
and stones or branches, placed in a peculiar manner,
warned the initiated, but otherwise there was no sign of
impending danger.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Some few nations maintain the predominancy and
force the weaker to pay tribute.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> When two of these
dominant nations war with each other, the conflict is
more sanguinary. No scalps are taken, but in some
cases the head, hands, or feet of the conquered slain are
severed as trophies. The Cahrocs sometimes fight hand
to hand with ragged stones, which they use with deadly
effect. The Rogue River Indians kill all their male
prisoners, but spare the women and children.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
elk-horn knives and hatchets are the result of much
labor and patience.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>The women are very ingenious in plaiting grass, or
fine willow-roots, into mats, baskets, hats, and strips of
parti-colored braid for binding up the hair. On these,
angular patterns are worked by using different shades of
material, or by means of dyes of vegetable extraction.
The baskets are of various sizes, from the flat, basin-shaped,
water-tight, rush bowl for boiling food, to the
large pointed cone which the women carry on their
backs when root-digging or berry-picking.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> They are
also expert tanners, and, by a comparatively simple process,
will render skins as soft and pliable as cloth. The
hide is first soaked in water till the hair loosens, then
stretched between trees or upright posts till half dry,
when it is scraped thoroughly on both sides, well beaten
with sticks, and the brains of some animal, heated at a
fire, are rubbed on the inner side to soften it. Finally it
is buried in moist ground for some weeks.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MANUFACTURES AND BOATS.</p>

<p>The interior tribes manifest no great skill in boat-making,
but along the coast and near the mouth of the
Klamath and Rogue rivers, very good canoes are found.
They are still, however, inferior to those used on the
Columbia and its tributaries. The lashed-up-hammock-shaped
bundle of rushes, which is so frequently met in
the more southern parts of California, has been seen on
the Klamath,<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> but I have reason to think that it is only
used as a matter of convenience, and not because no
better boat is known. It is certain that dug-out canoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
were in use on the same river, and within a few miles of
the spot where tule buoys obtain. The fact is, this bundle
of rushes is the best craft that could be invented for
salmon-spearing. Seated astride, the weight of the fisherman
sinks it below the surface; he can move it noiselessly
with his feet so that there is no splashing of paddles
in the sun to frighten the fish; it cannot capsize,
and striking a rock does it no injury. Canoes are hollowed
from the trunk of a single redwood, pine, fir, sycamore,
or cottonwood tree. They are blunt at both ends
and on Rogue River many of them are flat-bottomed.
It is a curious fact that some of these canoes are made
from first to last without being touched with a sharp-edged
tool of any sort. The native finds the tree
ready felled by the wind, burns it off to the required
length, and hollows it out by fire. Pitch is spread on
the parts to be burned away, and a piece of fresh bark
prevents the flames from extending too far in the wrong
direction. A small shelf, projecting inward from
the stern, serves as a seat. Much trouble is sometimes
taken with the finishing up of these canoes, in the
way of scraping and polishing, but in shape they lack
symmetry. On the coast they are frequently large; Mr
Powers mentions having seen one at Smith River forty-two
feet long, eight feet four inches wide, and capable
of carrying twenty-four men and five tons of merchandise.
The natives take great care of their canoes, and
always cover them when out of the water to protect them
from the sun. Should a crack appear they do not caulk
it, but stitch the sides of the split tightly together with
withes. They are propelled with a piece of wood, half
pole, half paddle.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEALTH IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Wealth, which is quite as important here as in any
civilized communities, and of much more importance than
is customary among savage nations, consists in shell-money,
called <i>allicochick</i>, white deer-skins, canoes, and,
indirectly, in women. The shell which is the regular
circulating medium is white, hollow, about a quarter of an
inch through, and from one to two inches in length. On
its length depends its value. A gentleman, who writes
from personal observation, says: "all of the older Indians
have tattooed on their arms their standard of
value. A piece of shell corresponding in length to one
of the marks being worth five dollars, 'Boston money,'
the scale gradually increases until the highest mark is
reached. For five perfect shells corresponding in length
to this mark they will readily give one hundred dollars
in gold or silver."<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> White deer-skins are rare and considered
very valuable, one constituting quite an estate in
itself.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> A scalp of the red-headed woodpecker is equivalent
to about five dollars, and is extensively used as
currency on the Klamath. Canoes are valued according
to their size and finish. Wives, as they must be bought,
are a sign of wealth, and the owner of many is respected
accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>Among the Northern Californians, hereditary chieftainship
is almost unknown. If the son succeed the
father it is because the son has inherited the father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
wealth, and if a richer than he arise the ancient ruler is
deposed and the new chief reigns in his stead. But to
be chief means to have position, not power. He can
advise, but not command; at least, if his subjects do not
choose to obey him, he cannot compel obedience.</p>

<p>There is most frequently a head man to each village,
and sometimes a chief of the whole tribe, but in reality
each head of a family governs his own domestic circle
as he thinks best. As in certain republics, when powerful
applicants become multiplied&mdash;new offices are created,
as salmon-chief, elk-chief, and the like. In one or two
coast tribes the office is hereditary, as with the Patawats
on Mad River, and that mysterious tribe at Trinidad
Bay, mentioned by Mr Meyer, the Allequas.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>Their penal code is far from Draconian. A fine of a
few strings of allicochick appeases the wrath of a murdered
man's relatives and satisfies the requirements of
custom. A woman may be slaughtered for half the sum
it costs to kill a man. Occasionally banishment from
the tribe is the penalty for murder, but capital punishment
is never resorted to. The fine, whatever it is,
must be promptly paid, or neither city of refuge nor
sacred altar-horns will shield the murderer from the
vengeance of his victim's friends.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WOMEN AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.</p>

<p>In vain do we look for traces of that Arcadian simplicity
and disregard for worldly advantages generally accorded
to children of nature. Although I find no description
of an actual system of slavery existing among them,
yet there is no doubt that they have slaves. We shall
see that illegitimate children are considered and treated
as such, and that women, entitled by courtesy wives, are
bought and sold. Mr Drew asserts that the Klamath
children of slave parents, who, it may be, prevent the
profitable prostitution or sale of the mother, are killed
without compunction.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Marriage, with the Northern Californians, is essentially
a matter of business. The young brave must not
hope to win his bride by feats of arms or softer wooing,
but must buy her of her father, like any other chattel,
and pay the price at once, or resign in favor of a richer
man. The inclinations of the girl are in nowise consulted;
no matter where her affections are placed, she
goes to the highest bidder, and "Mammon wins his way
where seraphs might despair." Neither is it a trifling
matter to be bought as a wife; the social position of the
bride herself, as well as that of her father's family thereafter,
depends greatly upon the price she brings; her
value is voted by society at the price her husband pays
for her, and the father whose daughter commands the
greatest number of strings of allicochick, is greatly to be
honored. The purchase effected, the successful suitor
leads his blushing property to his hut and she becomes
his wife without further ceremony. Wherever this system
of wife-purchase obtains, the rich old men almost
absorb the female youth and beauty of the tribe, while
the younger and poorer men must content themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
with old and ugly wives. Hence their eagerness for that
wealth which will enable them to throw away their old
wives and buy new ones. When a marriage takes place
among the Modocs, a feast is given at the house of the
bride's father, in which, however, neither she nor the
bridegroom partake. The girl is escorted by the women
to a lodge, previously furnished by public contributions,
where she is subsequently joined by the man, who is
conducted by his male friends. All the company bear
torches, which are piled up as a fire in the lodge of the
wedded pair, who are then left alone. In some tribes
this wife-traffic is done on credit, or at least partially
so; but the credit system is never so advantageous
to the buyer as the ready-money system, for until
the full price is paid, the man is only 'half-married,'
and besides he must live with his wife's family and be
their slave until he shall have paid in full.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> The children
of a wife who has cost her husband nothing are
considered no better than bastards, and are treated by
society with contumely; nobody associates with them,
and they become essentially ostracized. In all this there
is one redeeming feature for the wife-buyer; should he
happen to make a bad bargain he can, in most instances,
send his wife home and get his money back. Mr Gibbs
asserts that they shoot their wives when tired of them,
but this appears inconsistent with custom.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ADULTERY AND CHASTITY.</p>

<p>Polygamy is almost universal, the number of wives
depending only on the limit of a man's wealth. The
loss of one eye, or expulsion from the tribe, are common
punishments for adultery committed by a man. A string
of beads, however, makes amends. Should the wife venture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
on any irregularity without just compensation, the
outraged honor of her lord is never satisfied until he
has seen her publicly disemboweled. Among the Hoopahs
the women are held irresponsible and the men alone
suffer for the crime.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Illegitimate children are life-slaves
to some male relative of the mother, and upon them
the drudgery falls; they are only allowed to marry one
in their own station, and their sole hope of emancipation
lies in a slow accumulation of allicochick, with which
they can buy their freedom. We are told by Mr Powers
that a Modoc may kill his mother-in-law with impunity.
Adultery, being attended with so much danger,
is comparatively rare, but among the unmarried, who
have nothing to fear, a gross licentiousness prevails.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>Among the Muckalucs a dance is instituted in honor
of the arrival of the girls at the age of puberty. On
the Klamath, during the period of menstruation the
women are banished from the village, and no man may
approach them. Although the principal labor falls to
the lot of the women, the men sometimes assist in building
the wigwam, or even in gathering acorns and roots.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
Kane mentions that the Shastas, or, as he calls them,
the Chastays, frequently sell their children as slaves to
the Chinooks.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Dances and festivities, of a religio-playful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
character, are common, as when a whale is
stranded, an elk snared, or when the salmon come.
There is generally a kind of thanksgiving-day once a
year, when the people of neighboring tribes meet and
dance. The annual feast of the Veeards is a good illustration
of the manner of these entertainments. The
dance, which takes place in a large wigwam, is performed
by as many men as there is room for, and a
small proportion of women. They move in a circle
slowly round the fire, accompanying themselves with
their peculiar chant. Each individual is dressed in all
the finery he can muster; every valuable he possesses in
the way of shells, furs, or woodpecker-scalps, does duty
on this occasion; so that the wealth of the dancers may
be reckoned at a glance. When the dance has concluded,
an old gray-beard of the tribe rises, and pronounces
a thanksgiving oration, wherein he enumerates the benefits
received, the riches accumulated, and the victories
won during the year; exhorting the hearers meanwhile,
by good conduct and moral behavior, to deserve yet
greater benefits. This savage Nestor is listened to in
silence and with respect; his audience seeming to drink
in with avidity every drop of wisdom that falls from his
lips; but no sooner is the harangue concluded than every
one does his best to violate the moral precepts so lately
inculcated, by a grand debauch.</p>

<p>The Cahrocs have a similar festival, which they call
the Feast of the Propitiation. Its object is much the
same as that of the feast just described, but in place
of the orator, the chief personage of the day is called
the Chareya, which is also the appellation of their deity.
No little honor attaches to the position, but much suffering
is also connected with it. It is the duty of the
Chareya-man to retire into the mountains, with one attendant
only, and there to remain for ten days, eating
only enough to keep breath in his body. Meanwhile
the Cahrocs congregate in honor of the occasion, dance,
sing, and make merry. When the appointed period has
elapsed, the Chareya-man returns to camp, or is carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
by deputies sent out for the purpose, if he have not
strength to walk. His bearers are blindfolded, for no
human being may look upon the face of the Chareya-man
and live. His approach is the signal for the abrupt
breaking up of the festivities. The revelers disperse
in terror, and conceal themselves as best they may
to avoid catching sight of the dreaded face, and where
a moment before all was riot and bustle, a deathly stillness
reigns. Then the Chareya-man is conducted to the
sweat-house, where he remains for a time. And now
the real Propitiation-Dance takes place, the men alone
participating in its sacred movements, which are accompanied
by the low, monotonous chant of singers. The
dance over, all solemnity vanishes, and a lecherous saturnalia
ensues, which will not bear description. The gods
are conciliated, catastrophes are averted, and all is joy
and happiness.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SPORTS AND GAMES.</p>

<p>A passion for gambling obtains among the northern Californians
as elsewhere. Nothing is too precious or too insignificant
to be staked, from a white or black deer-skin,
which is almost priceless, down to a wife, or any other
trifle. In this manner property changes hands with
great rapidity.</p>

<p>I have already stated that on the possession of riches
depend power, rank, and social position, so that there is
really much to be lost or won. They have a game played
with little sticks, of which some are black, but the most
white. These they throw around in a circle, the object being
seemingly to make the black ones go farther than the
white. A kind of guess-game is played with clay balls.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
There is also an international game, played between
friendly tribes, which closely resembles our 'hockey.'
Two poles are set up in the ground at some distance
apart, and each side, being armed with sticks, endeavors
to drive a wooden ball round the goal opposite to it.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
In almost all their games and dances they are accompanied
by a hoarse chanting, or by some kind of uncouth
music produced by striking on a board with lobster-claws
fastened to sticks, or by some other equally primitive
method. Before the introduction of spirituous liquors
by white men drunkenness was unknown. With their
tobacco for smoking, they mix a leaf called <i>kinnik-kinnik</i>.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>

<p>The diseases and ailments most prevalent among these
people are scrofula, consumption, rheumatism, a kind of
leprosy, affection of the lungs, and sore eyes, the last
arising from the dense smoke which always pervades
their cabins.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> In addition to this they have imaginary
disorders caused by wizards, witches, and evil spirits,
who, as they believe, cause snakes and other reptiles to
enter into their bodies and gnaw their vitals. Some few
roots and herbs used are really efficient medicine, but
they rely almost entirely upon the mummeries and incantations
of their medicine men and women.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Their
whole system of therapeutics having superstition for a
basis, mortality is great among them, which may be one
of the causes of the continent being, comparatively
speaking, so thinly populated at the time of its discovery.
Syphilis, one of the curses for which they may
thank the white man, has made fearful havoc among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
them. Women doctors seem to be more numerous than
men in this region; acquiring their art in the <i>temescal</i> or
sweat-house, where unprofessional women are not admitted.
Their favorite method of cure seems to consist
in sucking the affected part of the patient until the blood
flows, by which means they pretend to extract the disease.
Sometimes the doctress vomits a frog, previously
swallowed for the occasion, to prove that she has not
sucked in vain. She is frequently assisted by a second
physician, whose duty it is to discover the exact spot
where the malady lies, and this she effects by barking
like a dog at the patient until the spirit discovers to her
the place. Mr Gibbs mentions a case where the patient
was first attended by four young women, and afterward
by the same number of old ones. Standing round the
unfortunate, they went through a series of violent gesticulations,
sitting down when they could stand no longer,
sucking, with the most laudable perseverance, and moaning
meanwhile most dismally. Finally, when with their
lips and tongue they had raised blisters all over the
patient, and had pounded his miserable body with hands
and knees until they were literally exhausted, the performers
executed a swooning scene, in which they sank
down apparently insensible.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> The Rogue River medicine-men
are supposed to be able to wield their mysterious
power for harm, as well as for good, so that should
a patient die, his relatives kill the doctor who attended
him; or in case deceased could not afford medical attendance,
they kill the first unfortunate disciple of Æsculapius
they can lay hands on, frequently murdering one
belonging to another tribe; his death, however, must be
paid for.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>But the great institution of the Northern Californians
is their temescal, or sweat-house, which consists of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
hole dug in the ground, and roofed over in such a manner
as to render it almost air-tight. A fire is built in the
centre in early fall, and is kept alive till the following
spring, as much attention being given to it as ever
was paid to the sacred fires of Hestia; though between
the subterranean temescal, with its fetid atmosphere,
and lurid fire-glow glimmering faintly through dense
smoke on swart, gaunt forms of savages, and the stately
temple on the Forum, fragrant with fumes of incense,
the lambent altar-flame glistening on the pure white
robes of the virgin priestesses, there is little likeness.
The temescal<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> is usually built on the brink of a stream;
a small hatchway affords entrance, which is instantly
closed after the person going in or out. Here congregate
the men of the village and enact their sudorific
ceremonies, which ordinarily consist in squatting round
the fire until a state of profuse perspiration sets in, when
they rush out and plunge into the water. Whether
this mode of treatment is more potent to kill or to cure
is questionable. The sweat-house serves not only as
bath and medicine room, but also as a general rendezvous
for the male drones of the village. The women,
with the exception of those practicing or studying medicine,
are forbidden its sacred precincts on pain of death;
thus it offers as convenient a refuge for henpecked husbands
as a civilized club-house. In many of the tribes
the men sleep in the temescal during the winter, which,
notwithstanding the disgusting impurity of the atmosphere,
affords them a snug retreat from the cold gusty
weather common to this region.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BURIAL AND MOURNING.</p>

<p>Incremation obtains but slightly among the Northern
Californians, the body usually being buried in a recumbent
position. The possessions of the deceased are either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
interred with him, or are hung around the grave; sometimes
his house is burned and the ashes strewn over his
burial-place. Much noisy lamentation on the part of
his relatives takes place at his death, and the widow
frequently manifests her grief by sitting on, or even half
burying herself in, her husband's grave for some days,
howling most dismally meanwhile, and refusing food and
drink; or, on the upper Klamath, by cutting her hair
close to the head, and so wearing it until she obtains consolation
in another spouse. The Modocs hired mourners
to lament at different places for a certain number of
days, so that the whole country was filled with lamentation.
These paid mourners were closely watched, and
disputes frequently arose as to whether they had fulfilled
their contract or not.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Occasionally the body is doubled
up and interred in a sitting position, and, rarely, it is
burned instead of buried. On the Klamath a fire is kept
burning near the grave for several nights after the burial,
for which rite various reasons are assigned. Mr Powers
states that it is to light the departed shade across a certain
greased pole, which is supposed to constitute its only
approach to a better world. Mr Gibbs affirms that the
fire is intended to scare away the devil, obviously an
unnecessary precaution as applied to the Satan of civilization,
who by this time must be pretty familiar with
the element. The grave is generally covered with a
slab of wood, and sometimes two more are placed erect
at the head and foot; that of a chief is often surrounded
with a fence; nor must the name of a dead person ever
be mentioned under any circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">BURIAL CEREMONIES AT PITT RIVER.</p>

<p>The following vivid description of a last sickness and
burial by the Pitt River Indians, is taken from the letter
of a lady eye-witness to her son in San Francisco:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was evening. We seated ourselves upon a log,
your father, Bertie, and I, near the fire round which the
natives had congregated to sing for old Gesnip, the
chief's wife. Presently Sootim, the doctor, appeared,
dressed in a low-necked, loose, white muslin, sleeveless
waist fastened to a breech-cloth, and red buck-skin cap
fringed and ornamented with beads; the face painted
with white stripes down to the chin, the arms from
wrist to shoulder, in black, red, and white circles, which
by the lurid camp-fire looked like bracelets, and the legs
in white and black stripes,&mdash;presenting altogether a
merry-Andrew appearance. Creeping softly along, singing
in a low, gradually-increasing voice, Sootim approached
the invalid and poised his hands over her as
in the act of blessing. The one nearest him took up
the song, singing low at first, then the next until the
circle was completed; after this the pipe went round; then
the doctor taking a sip of water, partly uncovered the
patient and commenced sucking the left side; last of all
he took a pinch of dirt and blew it over her. This is
their curative process, continued night after night, and
long into the night, until the patient recovers or dies.</p>

<p>Next day the doctor came to see me, and I determined
if possible to ascertain his own ideas of these things.
Giving him some <i>muck-a-muck</i>,<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> I asked him, "What do
you say when you talk over old Gesnip?" "I talk to
the trees, and to the springs, and birds, and sky, and
rocks," replied Sootim, "to the wind, and rain, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
leaves, I beg them all to help me." Iofalet, the doctor's
companion on this occasion, volunteered the remark:
"When Indian die, doctor very shamed, all same Boston
doctor;<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> when Indian get well, doctor very smart, all
same Boston doctor." Gesnip said she wanted after death
to be put in a box and buried in the ground, and not
burned. That same day the poor old woman breathed
her last&mdash;the last spark of that wonderful thing called
life flickered and went out; there remained in that rude
camp the shriveled dusky carcass, the low dim intelligence
that so lately animated it having fled&mdash;whither? When
I heard of it I went to the camp and found them dressing
the body. First they put on Gesnip her best white
clothes, then the next best, placing all the while whatever
was most valuable, beads, belts, and necklaces, next the
body. Money they put into the mouth, her daughter
contributing about five dollars. The knees were then
pressed up against the chest, and after all of her own
clothing was put on, the body was rolled up in the best
family bear-skin, and tied with strips of buckskin.</p>

<p>Then Soomut, the chief and husband, threw the bundle
over his shoulders, and started off for the cave where
they deposit their dead, accompanied by the whole
band crying and singing, and throwing ashes from the
camp-fire into the air. And thus the old barbarian
mourns: "Soomut had two wives&mdash;one good, one bad;
but she that was good was taken away, while she that is
bad remains. O Gesnip gone, gone, gone!" And the
mournful procession take up the refrain: "O Gesnip
gone, gone, gone!" Again the ancient chief: "Soomut
has a little boy, Soomut has a little girl, but no one is
left to cook their food, no one to dig them roots. O
Gesnip gone, gone, gone!" followed by the chorus. Then
again Soomut: "White woman knows that Gesnip was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
strong to work; she told me her sorrow when Gesnip
died. O Gesnip gone, gone, gone!" and this was kept
up during the entire march, the dead wife's virtues sung
and chorused by the whole tribe, accompanied by the
scattering of ashes and lamentations which now had become
very noisy. The lady further states that the scene
at the grave was so impressive that she was unable to
restrain her tears. No wonder then that these impulsive
children of nature carry their joy and sorrow to excess,
even so far as in this instance, where the affectionate
daughter of the old crone had to be held by her companions
from throwing herself into the grave of her dead
mother. After all, how slight the shades of difference
in hearts human, whether barbaric or cultured!</p>

<p>As before mentioned, the ruling passion of the savage
seems to be love of wealth; having it, he is respected,
without it he is despised; consequently he is treacherous
when it profits him to be so, thievish when he
can steal without danger, cunning when gain is at stake,
brave in defense of his lares and penates. Next to
his excessive venality, abject superstition forms the
most prominent feature of his character. He seems
to believe that everything instinct with animal life&mdash;with
some, as with the Siahs, it extends to vegetable life
also&mdash;is possessed by evil spirits; horrible fancies fill his
imagination. The rattling of acorns on the roof, the
rustling of leaves in the deep stillness of the forest is
sufficient to excite terror. His wicked spirit is the very
incarnation of fiendishness; a monster who falls suddenly
upon the unwary traveler in solitary places and rends
him in pieces, and whose imps are ghouls that exhume
the dead to devour them.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Were it not for the diabolic view he takes of nature,
his life would be a comparatively easy one. His wants
are few, and such as they are, he has the means of supplying
them. He is somewhat of a stoic, his motto being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
never do to-day what can be put off until to-morrow,
and he concerns himself little with the glories of peace
or war. Now and then we find him daubing himself
with great stripes of paint, and looking ferocious, but
ordinarily he prefers the calm of the peaceful temescal
to the din of battle. The task of collecting a winter
store of food he converts into a kind of summer picnic,
and altogether is inclined to make the best of things, in
spite of the annoyance given him in the way of reservations
and other benefits of civilization. Taken as a
whole, the Northern Californian is not such a bad specimen
of a savage, as savages go, but filthiness and greed
are not enviable qualities, and he has a full share of
both.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIANS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Central Californians</span> occupy a yet larger extent
of territory, comprising the whole of that portion of
California extending, north and south, from about 40°
30´ to 35°, and, east and west, from the Pacific Ocean to
the Californian boundary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">NATIONS OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The Native Races of this region are not divided, as in
the northern part of the state, into comparatively large
tribes, but are scattered over the face of the country in
innumerable little bands, with a system of nomenclature
so intricate as to puzzle an &OElig;dipus. Nevertheless, as
among the most important, I may mention the following:
The <i>Tehamas</i>, from whom the county takes its name;
the <i>Pomos</i>, which name signifies 'people', and is the
collective appellation of a number of tribes living in Potter
Valley, where the head-waters of Eel and Russian
rivers interlace, and extending west to the ocean and
south to Clear Lake. Each tribe of the nation takes a
distinguishing prefix to the name of Pomo, as, the <i>Castel
Pomos</i> and <i>Ki Pomos</i> on the head-waters of Eel River;
the <i>Pome Pomos</i>, Earth People, in Potter Valley;
the <i>Cahto Pomos</i>, in the valley of that name; the
<i>Choam Chadéla Pomos</i>, Pitch-pine People, in Redwood
Valley; the <i>Matomey Ki Pomos</i>, Wooded Valley People,
about Little Lake; the <i>Usals</i>, or <i>Camalél Pomos</i>, Coast
People, on Usal Creek; the <i>Shebalne Pomos</i>, Neighbor
People, in Sherwood Valley, and many others. On
Russian River, the <i>Gallinomeros</i> occupy the valley below
Healdsburg; the <i>Sanéls</i>, <i>Socoas</i>, <i>Lamas</i>, and <i>Seacos</i>, live in
the vicinity of the village of Sanél; the <i>Comachos</i> dwell in
Ranchería and Anderson valleys; the <i>Ukiahs</i>, or Yokias,
near the town of Ukiah, which is a corruption of their
name;<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> the <i>Gualalas</i><a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> on the creek which takes its name
from them, about twenty miles above the mouth of
Russian River. On the borders of Clear Lake were the
<i>Lopillamillos</i>, the <i>Mipacmas</i>, and <i>Tyugas</i>; the <i>Yolos</i>, or
Yolays, that is to say, 'region thick with rushes,' of
which the present name of the county of Yolo is a
corruption, lived on Cache Creek; the <i>Colusas</i> occupied
the west bank of the Sacramento; in the Valley of the
Moon, as the <i>Sonomas</i> called their country, besides themselves
there were the <i>Guillicas</i>, the <i>Kanimares</i>, the <i>Simbalakees</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
the <i>Petalumas</i>, and the <i>Wapos</i>; the <i>Yachichumnes</i>
inhabited the country between Stockton and Mount
Diablo. According to Hittel, there were six tribes in
Napa Valley: the <i>Mayacomas</i>, the <i>Calajomanas</i>, the <i>Caymus</i>,
the <i>Napas</i>, the <i>Ulucas</i>, and the <i>Suscols</i>; Mr Taylor
also mentions the <i>Guenocks</i>, the <i>Tulkays</i>, and the <i>Socollomillos</i>;
in Suisun Valley were the <i>Suisunes</i>, the <i>Pulpones</i>,
the <i>Tolenos</i>, and the <i>Ullulatas</i>; the tribe of the celebrated
chief Marin lived near the mission of San Rafael, and
on the ocean-coast of Marin County were the <i>Bolanos</i>
and <i>Tamales</i>; the <i>Karquines</i> lived on the straits of that
name. Humboldt and Mülhlenpfordt mention the <i>Matalanes</i>,
<i>Salses</i>, and <i>Quirotes</i>, as living round the bay of San
Francisco. According to Adam Johnson, who was Indian
agent for California in 1850, the principal tribes
originally living at the Mission Dolores, and Yerba
Buena, were the <i>Ahwashtes</i>, <i>Altahmos</i>, <i>Romanans</i>, and
<i>Tulomos</i>; Choris gives the names of more than fifteen
tribes seen at the Mission, Chamisso of nineteen, and
transcribed from the mission books to the <span class="smcap"><a href="#TRIBAL_IV">Tribal Boundaries</a> </span>
of this group, are the names of nearly two hundred
rancherías. The <i>Socoisukas</i>, <i>Thamiens</i>, and <i>Gergecensens</i>
roamed through Santa Clara County. The
<i>Olchones</i> inhabited the coast between San Francisco and
Monterey; in the vicinity of the latter place were the
<i>Rumsens</i> or Runsiens, the <i>Ecclemaches</i>, <i>Escelens</i> or
Eslens, the <i>Achastliens</i>, and the <i>Mutsunes</i>. On the San
Joaquin lived the <i>Costrowers</i>, the <i>Pitiaches</i>, <i>Talluches</i>,
<i>Loomnears</i>, and <i>Amonces</i>; on Fresno River the <i>Chowclas</i>,
<i>Cookchaneys</i>, <i>Fonechas</i>, <i>Nookchues</i>, and <i>Howetsers</i>; the
<i>Eemitches</i> and <i>Cowiahs</i>, lived on Four Creeks; the <i>Waches</i>,
<i>Notoowthas</i>, and <i>Chunemmes</i> on King River, and on
Tulare Lake, the <i>Talches</i> and <i>Woowells</i>.</p>

<p>In their aboriginal manners and customs they differ
but little, so little, in fact, that one description will apply
to the whole division within the above-named limits.
The reader will therefore understand that, except where
a tribe is specially named, I am speaking of the whole
people collectively.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span></p>

<p>The conflicting statements of men who had ample opportunity
for observation, and who saw the people they
describe, if not in the same place, at least in the same
vicinity, render it difficult to give a correct description
of their physique. They do not appear to deteriorate
toward the coast, or improve toward the interior, so
uniformly as their northern neighbors; but this may be
accounted for by the fact that several tribes that formerly
lived on the coast have been driven inland by the
settlers and vice versa.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL PECULIARITIES.</p>

<p>Some ethnologists see in the Californians a stock
different from that of any other American race; but the
more I dwell upon the subject, the more convinced I am,
that, except in the broader distinctions, specific classifications
of humanity are but idle speculations. Their
height rarely exceeds five feet eight inches, and is more
frequently five feet four or five inches, and although
strongly they are seldom symmetrically built. A low retreating
forehead, black deep-set eyes, thick bushy eyebrows,
salient cheek-bones, a nose depressed at the root
and somewhat wide-spreading at the nostrils, a large
mouth with thick prominent lips, teeth large and white,
but not always regular, and rather large ears, is the prevailing
type. Their complexion is much darker than that
of the tribes farther north, often being nearly black; so
that with their matted, bushy hair, which is frequently
cut short, they present a very uncouth appearance.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<p>The question of beard has been much mooted; some
travelers asserting that they are bearded like Turks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
others that they are beardless as women. Having carefully
compared the pros and cons, I think I am justified
in stating that the Central Californians have beards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
though not strong ones, and that some tribes suffer it to
grow, while others pluck it out as soon as it appears.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>During summer, except on festal occasions, the apparel
of the men is of the most primitive character, a slight
strip of covering round the loins being full dress; but
even this is unusual, the majority preferring to be perfectly
unencumbered by clothing. In winter the skin
of a deer or other animal is thrown over the shoulders,
or sometimes a species of rope made from the feathers of
water-fowl, or strips of otter-skin, twisted together, is
wound round the body, forming an effectual protection
against the weather. The women are scarcely better
clad, their summer costume being a fringed apron of
tule-grass, which falls from the waist before and behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
nearly down to the knees, and is open at the sides.
Some tribes in the northern part of the Sacramento Valley
wear the round bowl-shaped hat worn by the natives
on the Klamath. During the cold season a half-tanned
deer-skin, or the rope garment above mentioned, is added.
The hair is worn in various styles. Some bind it up in
a knot on the back of the head, others draw it back and
club it behind; farther south it is worn cut short, and
occasionally we find it loose and flowing. It is not uncommon
to see the head adorned with chaplets of leaves
or flowers, reminding one of a badly executed bronze of
Apollo or Bacchus. Ear-ornaments are much in vogue;
a favorite variety being a long round piece of carved
bone or wood, sometimes with beads attached, which is
also used as a needle-case. Strings of shells and beads
also serve as ear-ornaments and necklaces. The head-dress
for gala days and dances is elaborate, composed of
gay feathers, skillfully arranged in various fashions.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PERSONAL ADORNMENT.</p>

<p>Tattooing is universal with the women, though confined
within narrow limits. They mark the chin in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
perpendicular lines drawn downward from the corners
and centre of the mouth, in the same manner as the
Northern Californians; they also tattoo slightly on the
neck and breast. It is said that by these marks women
of different tribes can be easily distinguished. The men
rarely tattoo, but paint the body in stripes and grotesque
patterns to a considerable extent. Red was the favorite
color, except for mourning, when black was used. The
friars succeeded in abolishing this custom except on occasions
of mourning, when affection for their dead would
not permit them to relinquish it. The New Almaden
cinnabar mine has been from time immemorial a source
of contention between adjacent tribes. Thither, from a
hundred miles away, resorted vermilion-loving savages,
and often such visits were not free from blood-shed.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
A thick coat of mud sometimes affords protection from
a chilly wind. It is a convenient dress, as it costs nothing,
is easily put on, and is no incumbrance to the wearer.
The nudity of the savage more often proceeds from an
indifference to clothing than from actual want. No people
are found entirely destitute of clothing when the
weather is cold, and if they can manage to obtain garments
of any sort at one time of year they can at another.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Their dwellings are about as primitive as their dress.
In summer all they require is to be shaded from the
sun, and for this a pile of bushes or a tree will suffice.
The winter huts are a little more pretentious.
These are sometimes erected on the level ground, but
more frequently over an excavation three or four feet
deep, and varying from ten to thirty feet in diameter.
Round the brink of this hole willow poles are sunk upright
in the ground and the tops drawn together, forming
a conical structure, or the upper ends are bent over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
and driven into the earth on the opposite side of the pit,
thus giving the hut a semi-globular shape. Bushes, or
strips of bark, are then piled up against the poles, and
the whole is covered with a thick layer of earth or mud.
In some instances, the interstices of the frame are filled
by twigs woven cross-wise, over and under, between the
poles, and the outside covering is of tule-reeds instead of
earth. A hole at the top gives egress to the smoke, and
a small opening close to the ground admits the occupants.</p>

<p>Each hut generally shelters a whole family of relations
by blood and marriage, so that the dimensions of
the habitation depend on the size of the family.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>Thatched oblong houses are occasionally met with in
Russian River Valley, and Mr Powers mentions having
seen one among the Gallinomeros which was of the form
of the letter L, made of slats leaned up against each
other, and heavily thatched. Along the centre the different
families or generations had their fires, while they
slept next the walls. Three narrow holes served as
doors, one at either end and one at the elbow.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> A collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
of native huts is in California called a <i>ranchería</i>,
from rancho, a word first applied by the Spaniards to
the spot where, in the island of Cuba, food was distributed
to repartimiento Indians.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD AND METHODS OF OBTAINING IT.</p>

<p>The bestial laziness of the Central Californian prevents
him from following the chase to any extent, or
from even inventing efficient game-traps. Deer are,
however, sometimes shot with bow and arrow. The
hunter, disguised with the head and horns of a stag,
creeps through the long grass to within a few yards of
the unsuspecting herd, and drops the fattest buck at his
pleasure. Small game, such as hares, rabbits, and birds,
are also shot with the arrow. Reptiles and insects of
all descriptions not poisonous are greedily devoured; in
fact, any life-sustaining substance which can be procured
with little trouble, is food for them. But their
main reliance is on acorns, roots, grass-seeds, berries
and the like. These are eaten both raw and prepared.
The acorns are shelled, dried in the sun, and
then pounded into a powder with large stones. From
this flour a species of coarse bread is made, which is
sometimes flavored with various kinds of berries or
herbs. This bread is of a black color when cooked, of
about the consistency of cheese, and is said, by those
who have tasted it, to be not at all unpalatable.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> The
dough is frequently boiled into pudding instead of being
baked. A sort of mush is made from clover-seed, which
is also described as being rather a savory dish. Grasshoppers

for winter use, they are dried in the sun; when for present
consumption, they are either mashed into a paste,
which is eaten with the fingers, ground into a fine powder
and mixed with mush, or they are saturated with
salt water, placed in a hole in the ground previously
heated, covered with hot stones, and eaten like shrimps
when well roasted. Dried chrysalides are considered a
bonne bouche, as are all varieties of insects and worms.
The boiled dishes are cooked in water-tight baskets,
into which hot stones are dropped. Meat is roasted
on sticks before the fire, or baked in a hole in the ground.
The food is conveyed to the mouth with the fingers.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers are taken in pits, into which they are
driven by setting the grass on fire, or by beating the
grass in a gradually lessening circle, of which the pit is
the centre. For seed-gathering two baskets are used; a
large one, which is borne on the back, and another
smaller and scoop-shaped, which is carried in the hand;
with this latter the tops of the ripe grass are swept, and
the seed thus taken is thrown over the left shoulder into
the larger basket. The seeds are then parched and pulverized,
and usually stored as pinole,<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> for winter use.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>

When acorns are scarce the Central Californian resorts
to a curious expedient to obtain them. The woodpecker,
or <i>carpintero</i> as the Spaniards call it, stores away acorns
for its own use in the trunks of trees. Each acorn is
placed in a separate hole, which it fits quite tightly.
These the natives take; but it is never until hunger
compels them to do so, as they have great respect for
their little caterer, and would hold it sacrilege to rob
him except in time of extreme need.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Wild fowl are
taken with a net stretched across a narrow stream between
two poles, one on either bank. Decoys are placed
on the water just before the net, one end of which is
fastened to the top of the pole on the farther bank. A
line passing through a hole in the top of the pole on the
bank where the fowler is concealed, is attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
nearest end of the net, which is allowed to hang low.
When the fowl fly rapidly up to the decoys, this end is
suddenly raised with a jerk, so that the birds strike it
with great force, and, stunned by the shock, fall into a
large pouch, contrived for the purpose in the lower part
of the net.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Fish are both speared and netted. A long pole, projecting
sometimes as much as a hundred feet over the
stream, is run out from the bank. The farther end is
supported by a small raft or buoy. Along this boom the
net is stretched, the nearer corner being held by a native.
As soon as a fish becomes entangled in the meshes
it can be easily felt, and the net is then hauled in.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
On the coast a small fish resembling the sardine is caught
on the beach in the receding waves by means of a hand-net,
in the manner practiced by the Northern Californian
heretofore described.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The Central Californians do not

one is stranded.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> In reality their food was not so bad
as some writers assert. Before the arrival of miners
game was so plentiful that even the lazy natives could
supply their necessities. The 'nobler race,' as usual,
thrust them down upon a level with swine. Johnson
thus describes the feeding of the natives at Sutter's Fort:
"Long troughs inside the walls were filled with a kind
of boiled mush made of the wheat-bran; and the Indians,
huddled in rows upon their knees before these
troughs, quickly conveyed their contents by the hand to
the mouth." "But," writes Powers to the author, "it
is a well-established fact that California Indians, even
when reared by Americans from infancy, if they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
been permitted to associate meantime with others of their
race, will, in the season of lush blossoming clover, go
out and eat it in preference to all other food."<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>In their personal habits they are filthy in the extreme.

which they catch and eat in the same manner as
their northern neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CALIFORNIAN WEAPONS.</p>

<p>Their weapons are bows and arrows, spears, and sometimes
clubs. The first-named do not differ in any essential
respect from those described as being used by
the Northern Californians. They are well made, from
two and a half to three feet long, and backed with sinew;
the string of wild flax or sinew, and partially covered
with bird's down or a piece of skin, to deaden the twang.</p>

<p>The arrows are short, made of reed or light wood,
and winged with three or four feathers. The head
is of flint, bone, obsidian, or volcanic glass, sometimes
barbed and sometimes diamond-shaped. It is fastened
loosely to the shaft, and can be extracted only from
a wound by cutting it out. The shaft is frequently
painted in order that the owner may be able to distinguish
his own arrows from others. Spears, or rather
javelins, are used, seldom exceeding from four and a half
to five feet in length. They are made of some tough
kind of wood and headed with the same materials as
the arrows. Occasionally the point of the stick is merely
sharpened and hardened in the fire.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
fishing-spear is movable, being attached to the shaft by
a line, so that when a fish is struck the pole serves as a
float. Some of the tribes formerly poisoned their arrows,
but it is probable that the custom never prevailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
to any great extent. M. du Petit-Thouars was told that
they used for this purpose a species of climbing plant
which grows in shady places. It is said that they also
poison their weapons with the venom of serpents.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
Pedro Fages mentions that the natives in the country
round San Miguel use a kind of sabre, made of hard
wood, shaped like a cimeter, and edged with sharp flints.
This they employ for hunting as well as in war, and
with such address that they rarely fail to break the leg
of the animal at which they hurl it.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BATTLES AND WEAPONS.</p>

<p>Battles, though frequent, were not attended with much
loss of life. Each side was anxious for the fight to be
over, and the first blood would often terminate the contest.
Challenging by heralds obtained. Thus the Shumeias
challenge the Pomos by placing three little sticks,
notched in the middle and at both ends, on a mound
which marked the boundary between the two tribes. If
the Pomos accept, they tie a string round the middle
notch. Heralds then meet and arrange time and place,
and the battle comes off as appointed.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Among some
tribes, children are sent by mutual arrangement into the
enemy's ranks during the heat of battle to pick up the
fallen arrows and carry them back to their owners to be
used again.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> When fighting, they stretch out in a long
single line and endeavor by shouts and gestures to intimidate
the foe.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the mildness of their disposition and
the inferiority of their weapons, the Central Californians
do not lack courage in battle, and when captured will
meet their fate with all the stoicism of a true Indian.
For many years after the occupation of the country by
the Spaniards, by abandoning their villages and lying
in ambush upon the approach of the enemy, they were
enabled to resist the small squads of Mexicans sent
against them from the presidios for the recovery of deserters
from the missions. During the settlement of the
country by white people, there were the usual skirmishes
growing out of wrong and oppression on the one side,
and retaliation on the other; the usual uprising among
miners and rancheros, and vindication of border law,
which demanded the massacre of a village for the stealing
of a cow.</p>

<p>Trespass on lands and abduction of women are the
usual causes of war among themselves. Opposing armies,
on approaching each other in battle array, dance and leap
from side to side in order to prevent their enemies from
taking deliberate aim. Upon the invasion of their territory
they rapidly convey the intelligence by means of
signals. A great smoke is made upon the nearest hilltop,
which is quickly repeated upon the surrounding
hills, and thus a wide extent of country is aroused in a
remarkably short time.</p>

<p>The custom of scalping, though not universal in California,
was practiced in some localities. The yet more
barbarous habit of cutting off the hands, feet, or head
of a fallen enemy, as trophies of victory, prevailed more
widely. They also plucked out and carefully preserved
the eyes of the slain.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that these savages were cannibals,
and there seems to be good reason to believe that they
did devour pieces of the flesh of a renowned enemy slain
in battle. Human flesh was, however, not eaten as food,
nor for the purpose of wreaking vengeance on or showing
hate for a dead adversary, but because they thought
that by eating part of a brave man they absorbed a portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
of his courage. They do not appear to have kept
or sold prisoners as slaves, but to have either exchanged
or killed them.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IMPLEMENTS AND MANUFACTURES.</p>

<p>They are not ingenious, and manufacture but few
articles requiring any skill. The principal of these are
the baskets in which, as I have already mentioned, they
carry water and boil their food. They are made of fine
grass, so closely woven as to be perfectly water-tight,
and are frequently ornamented with feathers, beads,
shells, and the like, worked into them in a very pretty
manner. Fletcher, who visited the coast with Sir Francis
Drake in 1579, describes them as being "made in
fashion like a deep boale, and though the matter were
rushes, or such other kind of stuffe, yet it was so cunningly
handled that the most part of them would hold
water; about the brimmes they were hanged with peeces
of the shels of pearles, and in some places with two or
three linkes at a place, of the chaines forenamed ...
and besides this, they were wrought vpon with the matted
downe of red feathers, distinguished into diuers workes
and formes."<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The baskets are of various sizes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
shapes, the most common being conical or wide and flat.
Their pipes are straight, the bowl being merely a continuation
of the stem, only thicker and hollowed out.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NO BOATS IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that these natives about the bay
of San Francisco and the regions adjacent, had no canoes
of any description. Their only means of navigation
were bundles of tule-rushes about ten feet long and three
or four wide, lashed firmly together in rolls, and pointed
at both ends. They were propelled, either end foremost,
with long double-bladed paddles. In calm weather, and
on a river, the centre, or thickest part of these rafts
might be tolerably dry, but in rough water the rower,
who sat astride, was up to his waist in water.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
been asserted that they even ventured far out to sea on
them, but that this was common I much doubt.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> They
were useful to spear fish from, but for little else; in proof
of which I may mention, on the authority of Roquefeuil,
that in 1809-11, the Koniagas employed by the
Russians at Bodega, killed seals and otters in San Francisco
Bay under the very noses of the Spaniards, and in
spite of all the latter, who appear to have had no boats
of their own, could do to prevent them. In their light
skin baidarkas, each with places for two persons only,
these bold northern boatmen would drop down the coast
from Bodega Bay, where the Russians were stationed,
or cross over from the Farallones in fleets of from forty
to fifty boats, and entering the Golden Gate creep along
the northern shore, beyond the range of the Presidio's
guns, securely establish themselves upon the islands of
the bay and pursue their avocation unmolested. For
three years, namely from 1809 to 1811, these northern
fishermen held possession of the bay of San Francisco,
during which time they captured over eight thousand
otters. Finally, it occurred to the governor, Don Luis
Argüello, that it would be well for the Spaniards to have
boats of their own. Accordingly four were built, but
they were so clumsily constructed, ill equipped, and
poorly manned, that had the Russians and Koniagas felt
disposed, they could easily have continued their incursions.
Once within the entrance, these northern barbarians
were masters of the bay, and such was their
sense of security that they would sometimes venture for
a time to stretch their limbs upon the shore. The capture
of several of their number, however, by the soldiers
from the fort, made them more wary thereafter.
Maurelle, who touched at Point Arenas in 1775, but did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
not enter the bay of San Francisco, says that "a vast
number of Indians now presented themselves on both
points, who passed from one to the other in small canoes
made of fule, where they talked loudly for two hours
or more, till at last two of them came alongside of the
ship, and most liberally presented us with plumes of
feathers, rosaries of bone, garments of feathers, as also
garlands of the same materials, which they wore round
their head, and a canister of seeds which tasted much
like walnuts." The only account of this voyage in my possession
is an English translation, in which "canoes made
of fule" might easily have been mistaken for boats or
floats of tule.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Split logs were occasionally used to
cross rivers, and frequently all means of transportation
were dispensed with, and swimming resorted to.</p>

<p>Captain Phelps, in a letter to the author, mentions
having seen skin boats, or baidarkas, on the Sacramento
River, but supposes that they were left there by those
same Russian employés.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Vancouver, speaking of a
canoe which he saw below Monterey, says: "Instead of
being composed of straw, like those we had seen on our
first visit to San Francisco, it was neatly formed of wood,
much after the Nootka fashion, and was navigated with
much adroitness by four natives of the country. Their
paddles were about four feet long with a blade at each
end; these were handled with great dexterity, either
entirely on one side or alternately on each side of their
canoe."<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> I account for the presence of this canoe in
the same manner that Captain Phelps accounts for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
skin canoes on the Sacramento, and think that it must
have come either from the south or north.</p>

<p>The probable cause of this absence of boats in Central
California is the scarcity of suitable, favorably located
timber. Doubtless if the banks of the Sacramento
and the shores of San Francisco Bay had been lined with
large straight pine or fir trees, their waters would have
been filled with canoes; yet after all, this is but a poor
excuse; for not only on the hills and mountains, at a
little distance from the water, are forests of fine trees,
but quantities of driftwood come floating down every
stream during the rainy season, out of which surely sufficient
material could be secured for some sort of boats.</p>

<p>Shells of different kinds, but especially the variety
known as <i>aulone</i>, form the circulating medium. They
are polished, sometimes ground down to a certain size,
and arranged on strings of different lengths.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHIEFTAINSHIP AND ITS RIGHTS.</p>

<p>Chieftainship is hereditary, almost without exception.
In a few instances I find it depending upon wealth, influence,
family, or prowess in war, but this rarely. In
some parts, in default of male descent, the females of
the family are empowered to appoint a successor.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Although
considerable dignity attaches to a chief, and his
family are treated with consideration, yet his power is
limited, his principal duties consisting in making peace
and war, and in appointing and presiding over feasts.
Every band has its separate head, and two or even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
three have been known to preside at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
Sometimes when several bands are dwelling together
they are united under one head chief, who, however, cannot
act for the whole without consulting the lesser chiefs.
Practically, the heads of families rule in their own
circle, and their internal arrangements are seldom interfered
with. Their medicine-men also wield a very powerful
influence among them.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Sometimes, when a flagrant
murder has been committed, the chiefs meet in
council and decide upon the punishment of the offender.
The matter is, however, more frequently settled by the
relatives of the victim, who either exact blood for blood
from the murderer or let the thing drop for a consideration.
Among the Neeshenams revenge must be had
within twelve months after the murder or not at all.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RULERS OF NEW ALBION.</p>

<p>According to Fletcher's narrative, there seems to have
been much more distinction of rank at the time of Drake's
visit to California than subsequent travelers have seen;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
however, allowance must be made for the exaggerations
invariably found in the reports of early voyagers. In
proof of this, we have only to take up almost any
book of travel in foreign lands printed at that time;
wherein dragons and other impossible animals are not
only zoölogically described, but carefully drawn and engraved,
as well as other marvels in abundance. Captain
Drake had several temptations to exaggerate. The
richer and more important the country he discovered,
the more would it redound to his credit to have been the
discoverer; the greater the power and authority of the
chief who formally made over his dominions to the
queen of England, the less likely to be disputed would
be that sovereign's claims to the ceded territory. Fletcher
never speaks of the chief of the tribe that received Drake,
but as 'the king,' and states that this dignitary was
treated with great respect and ceremony by the courtiers
who surrounded him. These latter were distinguished
from the canaille by various badges of rank. They
wore as ornaments chains "of a bony substance, euery
linke or part thereof being very little, and thinne, most
finely burnished, with a hole pierced through the middest.
The number of linkes going to make one chaine,
is in a manner infinite; but of such estimation it is
amongst them, that few be the persons that are admitted
to weare the same; and euen they to whom its lawfull
to use them, yet are stinted what number they shall vse,
as some ten, some twelue, some twentie, and as they exceed
in number of chaines, so thereby are they knowne
to be the more honorable personages." Another mark
of distinction was a "certain downe, which groweth vp
in the countrey vpon an herbe much like our lectuce,
which exceeds any other downe in the world for finenesse,
and beeing layed vpon their cawles, by no winds
can be remoued. Of such estimation is this herbe
amongst them, that the downe thereof is not lawfull to
be worne, but of such persons as are about the king (to
whom also it is permitted to weare a plume of feather
on their heads, in signe of honour), and the seeds are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
not vsed but onely in sacrifice to their gods." The king,
who was gorgeously attired in skins, with a crown of
feather-work upon his head, was attended by a regular
body-guard, uniformly dressed in coats of skins. His
coming was announced by two heralds or ambassadors,
one of whom prompted the other, during the proclamation,
in a low voice. His majesty was preceded in the
procession by "a man of large body and goodly aspect,
bearing the septer or royall mace;" all of which happened,
if we may believe the worthy chaplain of the
expedition, on the coast just above San Francisco Bay,
three hundred years ago.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

The inclinations of the bride seem to be consulted
here more than among the Northern Californians. It
is true she is sometimes bought from her parents, but if
she violently opposes the match she is seldom compelled
to marry or to be sold. Among some tribes the wooer,
after speaking with her parents, retires with the girl; if

of her seducer, whom he is justified in killing. Sometimes
the male offender is compelled to buy the object of
his unholy passions. In consequence of their strictness
in this particular, adultery is not common among themselves,
although a husband is generally willing to prostitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
his dearest wife to a white man for a consideration.
The Central Californian women are inclined to rebel
against the tyranny of their masters, more than is usual
in other tribes. A refractory Tahtoo wife is sometimes
frightened into submission. The women have a great
dread of evil spirits, and upon this weakness the husband
plays. He paints himself in black and white
stripes to personate an ogre, and suddenly jumping in
among his terrified wives, brings them speedily to penitence.
Child-bearing falls lightly on the Californian
mother. When the time for delivery arrives she betakes
herself to a quiet place by the side of a stream; sometimes
accompanied by a female friend, but more frequently
alone. As soon as the child is born the mother
washes herself and the infant in the stream. The child
is then swaddled from head to foot in strips of soft skin,
and strapped to a board, which is carried on the mother's
back. When the infant is suckled, it is drawn round in
front and allowed to hang there, the mother meanwhile
pursuing her usual avocations. So little does child-bearing
affect these women, that, on a journey, they will
frequently stop by the way-side for half an hour to be
delivered, and then overtake the party, who have traveled
on at the usual pace. Painful parturition, though
so rare, usually results fatally to both mother and child
when it does occur. This comparative exemption from
the curse, "in sorrow shalt thou bring forth," is doubtless
owing partly to the fact that the sexes have their
regular season for copulation, just as animals have theirs,
the women bringing forth each year with great regularity.
A curious custom prevails, which is, however,
by no means peculiar to California. When child-birth
overtakes the wife, the husband puts himself to bed, and
there grunting and groaning he affects to suffer all the
agonies of a woman in labor. Lying there, he is nursed
and tended for some days by the women as carefully as
though he were the actual sufferer. Ridiculous as this
custom is, it is asserted by Mr Tylor to have been practiced
in western China, in the country of the Basques,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
by the Tibareni at the south of the Black Sea, and in
modified forms by the Dyaks of Borneo, the Arawaks
of Surinam, and the inhabitants of Kamchatka and
Greenland.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The females arrive early at the age of
puberty,<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> and grow old rapidly.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CALIFORNIAN DIVERSIONS.</p>

<p>Most important events, such as the seasons of hunting,
fishing, acorn-gathering, and the like, are celebrated
with feasts and dances which differ in no essential respect
from those practiced by the Northern Californians.
They usually dance naked, having their heads adorned
with feather ornaments, and their bodies and faces
painted with glaring colors in grotesque patterns. Broad
stripes, drawn up and down, across, or spirally round
the body, form the favorite device; sometimes one half
of the body is colored red and the other blue, or the
whole person is painted jet black and serves as a ground
for the representation of a skeleton, done in white, which
gives the wearer a most ghastly appearance.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
dancing is accompanied by chantings, clapping of hands,
blowing on pipes of two or three reeds and played with
the nose or mouth, beating of skin drums, and rattling
of tortoise-shells filled with small pebbles. This horrible
discord is, however, more for the purpose of marking
time than for pleasing the ear.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The women are
seldom allowed to join in the dance with the men, and
when they are so far honored, take a very unimportant
part in the proceedings, merely swaying their bodies to
and fro in silence.</p>

<p>Plays, representing scenes of war, hunting, and private
life, serve to while away the time, and are performed
with considerable skill. Though naturally the very incarnation
of sloth, at least as far as useful labor is concerned,
they have one or two games which require some
exertion. One of these, in vogue among the Meewocs,
is played with bats and an oak-knot ball. The former
are made of a pliant stick, having the end bent round
and lashed to the main part so as to form a loop, which
is filled with a network of strings. They do not strike
but push the ball along with these bats. The players
take sides, and each party endeavors to drive the ball
past the boundaries of the other. Another game, which
was formerly much played at the missions on the coast,
requires more skill and scarcely less activity. It consists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
in throwing a stick through a hoop which is rapidly
rolled along the ground. If the player succeeds in this,
he gains two points; if the stick merely passes partially
through, so that the hoop remains resting upon it, one
point is scored.</p>

<p>But, as usual, games of chance are much preferred to
games of skill. The chief of these is the same as that
already described in the last chapter as being played by
the natives all along the coasts of Oregon, Washington,
and British Columbia, and which bears so close a resemblance
to the odd-and-even of our school-days. They
are as infatuated on this subject as their neighbors, and
quite as willing to stake the whole of their possessions
on an issue of chance. They smoke a species of strong
tobacco in the straight pipes before mentioned;<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> but
they have no native intoxicating drink.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICINE AND SWEAT-HOUSES.</p>

<p>The principal diseases are small-pox, various forms of
fever, and syphilis. Owing to their extreme filthiness
they are also very subject to disgusting eruptions of the
skin. Women are not allowed to practice the healing
art, as among the Northern Californians, the privileges
of quackery being here reserved exclusively to the men.
Chanting incantations, waving of hands, and the sucking
powers obtain. Doctors are supposed to have power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
over life and death, hence if they fail to effect a cure,
they are frequently killed.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> They demand the most
extortionate fees in return for their services, and often
refuse to officiate unless the object they desire is promised
them. Sweat-houses similar to those already described
are in like manner used as a means of cure for
every kind of complaint.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> They have another kind of
sudatory. A hole is dug in the sand of a size sufficient
to contain a person lying at full length; over this a fire is
kept burning until the sand is thoroughly heated, when
the fire is removed and the sand stirred with a stick
until it is reduced to the required temperature. The
patient is then placed in the hole and covered, with the
exception of his head, with sand. Here he remains
until in a state of profuse perspiration, when he is unearthed
and plunged into cold water. They are said to
practice phlebotomy, using the right arm when the body
is affected and the left when the complaint is in the
limbs. A few simple decoctions are made from herbs,
but these are seldom very efficient medicines, especially
when administered for the more complicated diseases
which the whites have brought among them. Owing to
the insufficient or erroneous treatment they receive,
many disorders which would be easily cured by us, degenerate
with them into chronic maladies, and are transmitted
to their children.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>Incremation is almost universal in this part of California.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
The body is decorated with feathers, flowers,
and beads, and after lying in state for some time, is
burned amid the howls and lamentations of friends and
relations. The ashes are either preserved by the family
of the deceased or are formally buried. The weapons
and effects of the dead are burned or buried with them.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
When a body is prepared for interment the knees are
doubled up against the chest and securely bound with
cords. It is placed in a sitting posture in the grave,
which is circular. This is the most common manner of
sepulture, but some tribes bury the body perpendicularly
in a hole just large enough to admit it, sometimes with
the head down, sometimes in a standing position. The
Pomos formerly burned their dead, and since they have
been influenced by the whites to bury them, they invariably
place the body with its head toward the south.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MOURNING FOR THE DEAD.</p>

<p>A scene of incremation is a weird spectacle. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
friends and relatives of the deceased gather round the
funeral pyre in a circle, howling dismally. As the flames
mount upward their enthusiasm increases, until in a
perfect frenzy of excitement, they leap, shriek, lacerate
their bodies, and even snatch a handful of smoldering
flesh from the fire, and devour it.</p>

<p>The ashes of the dead mixed with grease, are smeared
over the face as a badge of mourning, and the compound
is suffered to remain there until worn off by the action
of the weather. The widow keeps her head covered
with pitch for several months. In the Russian River
Valley, where demonstrations of grief appear to be yet
more violent than elsewhere, self-laceration is much
practiced. It is customary to have an annual Dance of
Mourning, when the inhabitants of a whole village collect
together and lament their deceased friends with
howls and groans. Many tribes think it necessary to
nourish a departed spirit for several months. This is
done by scattering food about the place where the remains
of the dead are deposited. A devoted Neeshenam
widow does not utter a word for several months after
the death of her husband; a less severe sign of grief is
to speak only in a low whisper for the same time.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>Regarding a future state their ideas are vague; some
say that the Meewocs believe in utter annihilation after
death, but who can fathom the hopes and fears that
struggle in their dark imaginings. They are not particularly
cruel or vicious; they show much sorrow for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
death of a relative; in some instances they are affectionate
toward their families.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CENTRAL CALIFORNIAN CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Although nearly all travelers who have seen and described
this people, place them in the lowest scale of
humanity, yet there are some who assert that the character
of the Californian has been maligned. It does not
follow, they say, that he is indolent because he does not
work when the fertility of his native land enables him
to live without labor; or that he is cowardly because he
is not incessantly at war, or stupid and brutal because
the mildness of his climate renders clothes and dwellings
superfluous. But is this sound reasoning? Surely a people
assisted by nature should progress faster than another,
struggling with depressing difficulties.</p>

<p>From the frozen, wind-swept plains of Alaska to
the malaria-haunted swamps of Darien, there is not a
fairer land than California; it is the neutral ground,
as it were, of the elements, where hyperboreal cold,
stripped of its rugged aspect, and equatorial heat,
tamed to a genial warmth, meet as friends, inviting,
all blusterings laid aside. Yet if we travel northward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
from the Isthmus, we must pass by ruined cities and
temples, traces of mighty peoples, who there flourished before
a foreign civilization extirpated them. On the arid
deserts of Arizona and New Mexico is found an incipient
civilization. Descending from the Arctic sea we meet
races of hunters and traders, which can be called neither
primitive nor primordial, living after their fashion as
men, not as brutes. It is not until we reach the Golden
Mean in Central California that we find whole tribes
subsisting on roots, herbs and insects; having no boats,
no clothing, no laws, no God; yielding submissively to
the first touch of the invader; held in awe by a few
priests and soldiers. Men do not civilize themselves.
Had not the Greeks and the Egyptians been driven on
by an unseen hand, never would the city of the Violet
Crown have graced the plains of Hellas, nor Thebes nor
Memphis have risen in the fertile valley of the Nile.
Why Greece is civilized, while California breeds a race
inferior to the lowest of their neighbors, save only perhaps
the Shoshones on their east, no one yet can tell.</p>

<p>When Father Junípero Serra established the Mission
of Dolores in 1776, the shores of San Francisco Bay
were thickly populated by the Ahwashtees, Ohlones,
Altahmos, Romanons, Tuolomos, and other tribes. The
good Father found the field unoccupied, for, in the vocabulary
of these people, there is found no word for god,
angel, or devil; they held no theory of origin or destiny.
A ranchería was situated on the spot where now
Beach street intersects Hyde street. Were it there now,
as contrasted with the dwellings of San Francisco, it
would resemble a pig-sty more than a human habitation.</p>

<p>On the Marin and Sonoma shores of the bay were the
Tomales and Camimares, the latter numbering, in 1824,
ten thousand souls. Marin, chief of the Tomales, was
for a long time the terror of the Spaniards, and his warriors
were ranked as among the fiercest of the Californians.
He was brave, energetic, and possessed of no
ordinary intelligence. When quite old he consented to
be baptized into the Romish Church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">YOSEMITE VALLEY INDIANS.</p>

<p>It has been suspected that the chief Marin was not a
full-bred Indian, but that he was related to a certain
Spanish sailor who was cast ashore from a wrecked galeon
on a voyage from Manila to Acapulco about the year
1750. The ship-wrecked Spaniards, it has been surmised,
were kindly treated by the natives; they married
native wives, and lived with the Tomales as of them,
and from them descended many of their chiefs; but of
this we have no proof.</p>

<p>Yosemite Valley was formerly a stronghold to which
tribes in that vicinity resorted after committing their
depredations upon white settlers. They used to make
their boast that their hiding place could never be discovered
by white men. But during the year 1850, the
marauders growing bold in their fancied security, the
whites arose and drove them into the mountains. Following
them thither under the guidance of Tenaya, an
old chief and confederate, the white men were suddenly
confronted by the wondrous beauties of the valley. The
Indians, disheartened at the discovery of their retreat,
yielded a reluctant obedience, but becoming again disaffected
they renewed their depredations. Shortly afterward
the Yosemite Indians made a visit to the Monos.
They were hospitably entertained, but upon leaving, could
not resist the temptation to drive off a few stray cattle belonging
to their friends. The Monos, enraged at this breach
of good faith, pursued and gave them battle. The warriors
of the valley were nearly exterminated, scarce half a
dozen remaining to mourn their loss. All their women
and children were carried away into captivity. These
Yosemite Indians consisted of a mixture from various
tribes, outlaws as it were from the surrounding tribes.
They have left as their legacy a name for every cliff and
waterfall within the valley. How marvelous would be
their history could we go back and trace it from the
beginning, these millions of human bands, who throughout
the ages have been coming and going, unknowing
and unknown!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">In the <span class="smcap">Southern Californians</span>, whose territory lies
south of the thirty-fifth parallel, there are less tribal
differences than among any people whom we have yet
encountered, whose domain is of equal extent. Those
who live in the south-eastern corner of the State are
thrown by the Sierra Nevada range of mountains into
the Shoshone family, to which, indeed, by affinity they
belong. The chief tribes of this division are the <i>Cahuillas</i>
and the <i>Diegueños</i>, the former living around the
San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains, and the
latter in the southern extremity of California. Around
each mission were scores of small bands, whose rancherías
were recorded in the mission books, the natives as
a whole being known only by the name of the mission.
When first discovered by Cabrillo in 1542, the islands
off the coast were inhabited by a superior people, but
these they were induced by the padres to abandon, following
which event the people rapidly faded away. The
natives called the island of Santa Cruz <i>Liniooh</i>, Santa
Rosa <i>Hurmal</i>, San Miguel <i>Twocan</i>, and San Nicolas <i>Ghalashat</i>.</p>

<p>As we approach the southern boundary of California
a slight improvement is manifest in the aborigines.
The men are here well made, of a stature quite up to
the average, comparatively fair-complexioned and pleasant-featured.
The children of the islanders are described
by the early voyagers as being white, with light hair and
ruddy cheeks, and the women as having fine forms,
beautiful eyes, and a modest demeanor.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The beard is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
plucked out with a bivalve shell, which answers the
purpose of pincers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>A short cloak of deer-skin or rabbit-skins sewed together,
suffices the men for clothing; and sometimes
even this is dispensed with, for they think it no shame
to be naked.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The women and female children wear a
petticoat of skin, with a heavy fringe reaching down to
the knees; in some districts they also wear short capes
covering the breasts.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> On the coast and, formerly, on
the islands, seals furnished the material.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> The more
industrious and wealthy embroider their garments profusely
with small shells. Around Santa Barbara rings of
bone or shell were worn in the nose; at Los Angeles
nasal ornaments were not the fashion. The women had
cylinder-shaped pieces of ivory, sometimes as much as
eight inches, in length, attached to the ears by a shell
ring. Bracelets and necklaces were made of pieces of
ivory ground round and perforated, small pebbles, and
shells.</p>

<p>Paint of various colors was used by warriors and
dancers. Mr Hugo Reid, who has contributed valuable
information concerning the natives of Los Angeles
County, states that girls in love paint the cheeks sparingly
with red ochre, and all the women, before they
grow old, protect their complexion from the effects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
the sun by a plentiful application of the same cosmetic.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
Vizcaino saw natives on the southern coast painted blue
and silvered over with some kind of mineral substance.
On his asking where they obtained the silver-like material
they showed him a kind of mineral ore, which
they said they used for purposes of ornamentation.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>They take much pride in their hair, which they wear
long. It is braided, and either wound round the head
turban-like,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> or twisted into a top-knot; some tie it in a
queue behind. According to Father Boscana the girls
are tattooed in infancy on the face, breast, and arms.
The most usual method was to prick the flesh with a
thorn of the cactus-plant; charcoal produced from the
maguey was then rubbed into the wounds, and an ineffaceable
blue was the result.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS AND FOOD.</p>

<p>Dwellings, in the greater part of this region, differ but
little from those of the Central Californians. In shape
they are conical or semi-globular, and usually consist of
a frame, formed by driving long poles into the ground,
covered with rushes and earth.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> On the coast of the
Santa Barbara Channel there seems to have been some
improvement in their style of architecture. It was probably
here that Cabrillo saw houses built after the manner
of those in New Spain.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It is possible that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
influences of the southern civilization may have extended
as far as this point. Father Boscana's description
of the temples or <i>vanquechs</i> erected by the natives in
the vicinity of San Juan Capistrano, in honor of their
god, Chinigchinich, is thus translated: "They formed an
enclosure of about four or five yards in circumference,
not exactly round, but inclining to an oval. This they
divided by drawing a line through the centre, and built
another, consisting of the branches of trees, and mats to
the height of about six feet, outside of which, in the
other division, they formed another of small stakes of
wood driven into the ground. This was called the gate,
or entrance, to the vanquech. Inside of this, and close
to the larger stakes, was placed a figure of their god
Chinigchinich, elevated upon a kind of hurdle. This is
the edifice of the vanquech."<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>Almost every living thing that they can lay their
hands on serves as food. Coyotes, skunks, wild cats,
rats, mice, crows, hawks, owls, lizards, frogs, snakes, excepting
him of the rattle, grasshoppers and other insects,
all are devoured by the inland tribes. Stranded
whales, animals of the seal genus, fish, and shell-fish,
form the main support of those inhabiting the coast.
Venison they are of course glad to eat when they can
get it, but as they are poor hunters, it is a rare luxury.
When they did hunt the deer they resorted to the same
artifice as their northern neighbors, placing a deer's
head and horns on their own head, and thus disguised
approaching within bow-shot. Bear-meat the majority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
refuse to eat from superstitious motives.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Grasshoppers
are eaten roasted. Acorns are shelled, dried, and pounded
in stone mortars into flour, which is washed and
rewashed in hot and cold water until the bitterness is
removed, when it is made into gruel with cold water, or
baked into bread. Various kinds of grass-seeds, herbs,
berries, and roots, are also eaten, both roasted and raw.
Wild fowl are caught in nets made of tules, spread
over channels cut through the rushes in places frequented
by the fowl, at a sufficient height above the
water to allow the birds to swim easily beneath them.
The game is gently driven or decoyed under the nets,
when at a given signal, a great noise is made, and the
terrified fowl, rising suddenly, become hopelessly entangled
in the meshes, and fall an easy prey. Or selecting
a spot containing clear water about two feet deep,
they fasten a net midway between the surface and the
bottom, and strewing the place with berries, which sink
to the bottom under the net, they retire. The fowl
approach and dive for the berries. The meshes of the
net readily admit the head, but hold the prisoner tight
upon attempting to withdraw it. And what is more,
their position prevents them from making a noise, and
they serve also as a decoy for others. Fish are taken in
seines made from the tough bark of the tioñe-tree. They
are also killed with spears having a movable bone head,
attached to a long line, so that when a fish is struck the
barb becomes loosened; line is then paid out until the
fish is exhausted with running, when it is drawn in.
Many of the inland tribes come down to the coast in the
fishing season, and remain there until the shoals leave,
when they return to the interior. Food is either boiled
by dropping hot stones into water-baskets, or, more frequently,
in vessels made of soap-stone.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<p>In their cooking, as in other respects, they are excessively
unclean. They bathe frequently, it is true, but
when not in the water they are wallowing in filth. Their
dwellings are full of offal and other impurities, and vermin
abound on their persons.</p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS AND WAR.</p>

<p>Bows and arrows, and clubs, are as usual the weapons
most in use. Sabres of hard wood, with edges that cut
like steel, are mentioned by Father Junípero Serra.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
War is a mere pretext for plunder; the slightest wrong,
real or imaginary, being sufficient cause for a strong tribe
to attack a weaker one. The smaller bands form temporary
alliances; the women and children accompanying
the men on a raid, carrying provisions for the march,
and during an engagement they pick up the fallen arrows
of the enemy and so keep their own warriors supplied.
Boscana says that no male prisoners are taken, and no
quarter given; and Hugo Reid affirms of the natives of
Los Angeles County that all prisoners of war, after being
tormented in the most cruel manner, are invariably
put to death. The dead are decapitated and scalped.
Female prisoners are either sold or retained as slaves.
Scalps, highly prized as trophies, and publicly exhibited
at feasts, may be ransomed, but no consideration would
induce them to part with their living captives.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>Among the few articles they manufacture are fish-hooks,
needles, and awls, made of bone or shell; mortars
and pestles of granite, and soap-stone cooking vessels,
and water-tight baskets.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> The clay vessels which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
frequently found among them now, were not made by
them before the arrival of the Spaniards. The stone
implements, however, are of aboriginal manufacture, and
are well made. The former are said to have been procured
mostly by the tribes of the mainland from the Santa
Rosa islanders.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The instruments which they used in
their manufactures were flint knives and awls; the latter
Fages describes as being made from the small bone of a
deer's fore-foot. The knife is double-edged, made of a
flint, and has a wooden haft, inlaid with mother of
pearl.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>On this coast we again meet with wooden canoes, although
the balsa, or tule raft, is also in use. These boats
are made of planks neatly fastened together and paid
with bitumen;<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> prow and stern, both equally sharp, are
elevated above the centre, which made them appear to
Vizcaino "como barquillos" when seen beside his own
junk-like craft. The paddles were long and double-bladed,
and their boats, though generally manned by
three or four men, were sometimes large enough to carry
twenty. Canoes dug out of a single log, scraped smooth
on the outside, with both ends shaped alike, were sometimes,
though more rarely, used.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The circulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
medium consisted of small round pieces of the white
mussel-shell. These were perforated and arranged on
strings, the value of which depended upon their length.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
I have said before that this money is supposed to have
been manufactured for the most part on Santa Rosa
Island. Hence it was distributed among the coast tribes,
who bought with it deer-skins, seeds, etc., from the people
of the interior.</p>

<p class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT AND PUNISHMENTS.</p>

<p>Each tribe acknowledged one head, whose province it
was to settle disputes,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> levy war, make peace, appoint
feasts, and give good advice. Beyond this he had little
power.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> He was assisted in his duties by a council of
elders. The office of chief was hereditary, and in the
absence of a male heir devolved upon the female nearest
of kin. She could marry whom she pleased, but her
husband obtained no authority through the alliance, all
the power remaining in his wife's hands until their eldest
boy attained his majority, when the latter at once assumed
the command.</p>

<p>A murderer's life was taken by the relatives of his
victim, unless he should gain refuge in the temple, in
which case his punishment was left to their god. Vengeance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
was, however, only deferred; the children of the
murdered man invariably avenged his death, sooner or
later, upon the murderer or his descendants. When
a chief grew too old to govern he abdicated in favor
of his son, on which occasion a great feast was given.
When all the people had been called together by criers,
"the crown was placed upon the head of the chief elect,
and he was enrobed with the imperial vestments," as
Father Boscana has it; that is to say, he was dressed in
a head-ornament of feathers, and a feather petticoat
reaching from the waist half-way down to the knees,
and the rest of his body painted black. He then went
into the temple and performed a pas seul before the god
Chinigchinich. Here, in a short time, he was joined by
the other chiefs, who, forming a circle, danced round
him, accompanied by the rattling of turtle-shells filled
with small stones. When this ceremony was over he
was publicly acknowledged chief.</p>

<p>As I said before, the chief had little actual authority
over individuals; neither was the real power vested in
the heads of families; but a system of influencing the
people was adopted by the chief and the elders, which
is somewhat singular. Whenever an important step was
to be taken, such as the killing of a malefactor, or the
invasion of an enemy's territory, the sympathies of the
people were enlisted by means of criers, who were sent
round to proclaim aloud the crime and the criminal, or
to dilate upon the wrongs suffered at the hands of the
hostile tribe; and their eloquence seldom failed to attain
the desired object.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MARRIAGE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The chief could have a plurality of wives, but the
common people were only allowed one.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
contracting a marriage varied. In Los Angeles County,
according to Mr Reid, the matter was arranged by a
preliminary interchange of presents between the male
relatives of the bridegroom and the female relatives of
the bride. The former proceeded in a body to the dwelling
of the girl, and distributed small sums in shell
money among her female kinsfolk, who were collected
there for the occasion. These afterward returned the
compliment by visiting the man and giving baskets of
meal to his people. A time was then fixed for the final
ceremony. On the appointed day the girl, decked in all
her finery, and accompanied by her family and relations,
was carried in the arms of one of her kinsfolk toward
the house of her lover; edible seeds and berries were
scattered before her on the way, which were scrambled
for by the spectators. The party was met half-way by
a deputation from the bridegroom, one of whom now
took the young woman in his arms and carried her to
the house of her husband, who waited expectantly.
She was then placed by his side, and the guests, after
scattering more seeds, left the couple alone. A great
feast followed, of which the most prominent feature was
a character-dance. The young men took part in this
dance in the rôles of hunters and warriors, and were
assisted by the old women, who feigned to carry off game,
or dispatch wounded enemies, as the case might be.
The spectators sat in a circle and chanted an accompaniment.</p>

<p>According to another form of marriage the man either
asked the girl's parents for permission to marry their
daughter, or commissioned one of his friends to do so.
If the parents approved, their future son-in-law took up
his abode with them, on condition that he should provide
a certain quantity of food every day. This was done to
afford him an opportunity to judge of the domestic qualities
of his future wife. If satisfied, he appointed a day
for the marriage, and the ceremony was conducted much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
in the same manner as that last described, except that
he received the girl in a temporary shelter erected in
front of his hut, and that she was disrobed before being
placed by his side.</p>

<p>Children were often betrothed in infancy, kept continually
in each other's society until they grew up, and
the contract was scarcely ever broken. Many obtained
their wives by abduction, and this was the cause of
many of the inter-tribal quarrels in which they were so
constantly engaged.</p>

<p>If a man ill-treated his wife, her relations took her
away, after paying back the value of her wedding presents,
and then married her to another. Little difficulty
was experienced in obtaining a divorce on any ground;
indeed, in many of the tribes the parties separated whenever
they grew tired of each other. Adultery was severely
punished. If a husband caught his wife in the
act, he was justified in killing her, or, he could give her
up to her seducer and appropriate the spouse of the latter
to himself.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CHILD-BIRTH.</p>

<p>At the time of child-birth many singular observances
obtained; for instance, the old women washed the
child as soon as it was born, and drank of the water;
the unhappy infant was forced to take a draught of
urine medicinally, and although the husband did not
affect the sufferings of labor, his conduct was supposed
in some manner to affect the unborn child, and he was
consequently laid under certain restrictions, such as not
being allowed to leave the house, or to eat fish and meat.
The women as usual suffer little from child-bearing.
One writer thus describes the accouchement of a woman
in the vicinity of San Diego: "A few hours before the
time arrives she gets up and quietly walks off alone, as
if nothing extraordinary was about to occur. In this
manner she deceives all, even her husband, and hides
herself away in some secluded nook, near a stream or
hole of water. At the foot of a small tree, which she can
easily grasp with both hands, she prepares her 'lying-in-couch,'
on which she lies down as soon as the labor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
pains come on. When the pain is on, she grasps the tree
with both hands, thrown up backward over her head, and
pulls and strains with all her might, thus assisting each
pain, until her accouchement is over. As soon as the
child is born, the mother herself ties the navel-cord with
a bit of buck-skin string, severing it with a pair of sharp
scissors, prepared for the occasion, after which the end
is burned with a coal of fire; the child is then thrown
into the water; if it rises to the surface and cries, it is
taken out and cared for; if it sinks, there it remains,
and is not even awarded an Indian burial. The affair
being all over, she returns to her usual duties, just as if
nothing had happened, so matter of fact are they in such
matters." Purification at child-birth lasted for three
days, during which time the mother was allowed no
food, and no drink but warm water. The ceremony, in
which mother and child participated, was as follows: In
the centre of the hut a pit was filled with heated stones,
upon which herbs were placed, and the whole covered
with earth, except a small aperture through which water
was introduced. The mother and child, wrapped in
blankets, stood over the pit and were soon in a violent
perspiration. When they became exhausted from the
effect of the steam and the heated air, they lay upon
the ground and were covered with earth, after which
they again took to the heated stones and steam. The
mother was allowed to eat no meat for two moons, after
which pills made of meat and wild tobacco were given
her. In some tribes she could hold no intercourse with
her husband until the child was weaned.</p>

<p>Children, until they arrived at the age of puberty,
remained under the control of their parents, afterward
they were subject only to the chief. Like the Spartan
youth, they were taught that abstinence, and indifference
to hardship and privations, constitute the only true
manhood. To render them hardy much unnecessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
pain was inflicted. They were forbidden to approach
the fire to warm themselves, or to eat certain seeds and
berries which were considered luxuries.</p>

<p>A youth, to become a warrior, must first undergo a
severe ordeal; his naked body was beaten with stinging
nettles until he was literally unable to move; then he
was placed upon the nest of a species of virulent ant,
while his friends irritated the insects by stirring them
up with sticks. The infuriated ants swarmed over
every part of the sufferer's body, into his eyes, his ears,
his mouth, his nose, causing indescribable pain.</p>

<p>Boscana states that the young were instructed to love
truth, to do good, and to venerate old age.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> At an
early age they were placed under the protection of a
tutelar divinity, which was supposed to take the form of
some animal. To discover the particular beast which
was to guide his future destinies, the child was intoxicated,<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
and for three or four days kept without food of
any kind. During this period he was continually harassed
and questioned, until, weak from want of food,
crazed with drink and importunity, and knowing that
the persecution would not cease until he yielded, he
confessed to seeing his divinity, and described what
kind of brute it was. The outline of the figure was
then molded in a paste made of crushed herbs, on the
breast and arms of the novitiate. This was ignited and
allowed to burn until entirely consumed, and thus the
figure of the divinity remained indelibly delineated in
the flesh. Hunters, before starting on an expedition,
would beat their faces with nettles to render them clear-sighted.
A girl, on arriving at the age of puberty, was
laid upon a bed of branches placed over a hole, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
had been previously heated, where she was kept with
very little food for two or three days. Old women
chanted songs, and young women danced round her at
intervals during her purification. In the vicinity of
San Diego the girl is buried all but her head, and the
ground above her is beaten until she is in a profuse
perspiration. This is continued for twenty-four hours,
the patient being at intervals during this time taken out
and washed, and then reimbedded. A feast and dance
follow.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>When the missionaries first arrived in this region,
they found men dressed as women and performing
women's duties, who were kept for unnatural purposes.
From their youth up they were treated, instructed, and
used as females, and were even frequently publicly married
to the chiefs or great men.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">AMUSEMENTS.</p>

<p>Gambling and dancing formed, as usual, their principal
means of recreation. Their games of chance differed
little from those played farther north. That of guessing
in which hand a piece of wood was held, before described,
was played by eight, four on a side, instead of
four. Another game was played by two. Fifty small
pieces of wood, placed upright in a row in the ground,
at distances of two inches apart, formed the score. The
players were provided with a number of pieces of split
reed, blackened on one side; these were thrown, points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
down, on the ground, and the thrower counted one for
every piece that remained white side uppermost; if he
gained eight he was entitled to another throw. If the
pieces all fell with the blackened side up they counted
also. Small pieces of wood placed against the upright
pegs, marked the game. They reckoned from opposite
ends of the row, and if one of the players threw just so
many as to make his score exactly meet that of his opponent,
the former had to commence again. Throwing
lances of reed through a rolling hoop was another source
of amusement. Professional singers were employed to
furnish music to a party of gamblers. An umpire was
engaged, whose duty it was to hold the stakes, count the
game, prevent cheating, and act as referee; he was also
expected to supply wood for the fire.</p>

<p>When they were not eating, sleeping, or gambling,
they were generally dancing; indeed, says Father Boscana,
"such was the delight with which they took part
in their festivities, that they often continued dancing day
and night, and sometimes entire weeks." They danced
at a birth, at a marriage, at a burial; they danced to
propitiate the divinity, and they thanked the divinity
for being propitiated by dancing. They decorated themselves
with shells and beads, and painted their bodies with
divers colors. Sometimes head-dresses and petticoats
of feathers were worn, at other times they danced naked.
The women painted the upper part of their bodies brown.
They frequently danced at the same time as the men, but
seldom with them. Time was kept by singers, and the
rattling of turtle-shells filled with pebbles. They were
good actors, and some of their character-dances were well
executed; the step, however, like their chanting, was
monotonous and unvarying. Many of their dances were
extremely licentious, and were accompanied with obscenities
too disgusting to bear recital. Most of them
were connected in some way with their superstitions and
religious rites.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span></p>

<p>These people never wandered far from their own territory,
and knew little or nothing of the nations lying beyond
their immediate neighbors. Mr Reid relates that
one who traveled some distance beyond the limits of his
own domain, returned with the report that he had seen
men whose ears descended to their hips; then he had
met with a race of Lilliputians; and finally had reached
a people so subtly constituted that they "would take a
rabbit, or other animal, and merely with the breath, inhale
the essence; throwing the rest away, which on examination
proved to be excrement."</p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS AND SUPERSTITIONS.</p>

<p>They had a great number of traditions, legends, and
fables. Some of these give evidence of a powerful imagination;
a few are pointed with a moral; but the majority
are puerile, meaningless, to us at least, and filled with
obscenities. It is said that, in some parts, the Southern
Californians are great snake-charmers, and that they
allow the reptiles to wind themselves about their bodies
and bite them, with impunity.</p>

<p>Feuds between families are nursed for generations;
the war is seldom more than one of words, however, unless
a murder is to be avenged, and consists of mutual
vituperations, and singing obscene songs about each other.
Friends salute by inquiries after each other's health. On
parting one says 'I am going,' the other answers 'go.'</p>

<p>They are very superstitious, and believe in all sorts of
omens and auguries. An eclipse frightens them beyond
measure, and shooting stars cause them to fall down in
the dust and cover their heads in abject terror. Many
of them believe that, should a hunter eat meat or fish
which he himself had procured, his luck would leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
him. For this reason they generally hunt or fish in
pairs, and when the day's sport is over, each takes what
the other has killed. Living as they do from hand to
mouth, content to eat, sleep, and dance away their existence,
we cannot expect to find much glimmering of the
simpler arts or sciences among them.</p>

<p>Their year begins at the winter solstice, and they count
by lunar months, so that to complete their year they are
obliged to add several supplementary days. All these
months have symbolic names. Thus December and
January are called the month of cold; February and
March, the rain; March and April, the first grass; April
and May, the rise of waters; May and June, the month
of roots; June and July, of salmon fishing; July and
August, of heat; August and September, of wild fruits;
September and October, of bulbous roots; October and
November, of acorns and nuts; November and December,
of bear and other hunting.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>

<p>Sorcerers are numerous, and as unbounded confidence
is placed in their power to work both good and evil,
their influence is great. As astrologers and soothsayers,
they can tell by the appearance of the moon the most
propitious day and hour in which to celebrate a feast,
or attack an enemy. Sorcerers also serve as almanacs for
the people, as it is their duty to note by the aspect of
the moon the time of the decease of a chief or prominent
man, and to give notice of the anniversary when it comes
round, in order that it may be duly celebrated. They
extort black-mail from individuals by threatening them
with evil. The charm which they use is a ball made of
mescal mixed with wild honey; this is carried under the
left arm, in a small leather bag,&mdash;and the spell is effected
by simply laying the right hand upon this bag. Neither
does their power end here; they hold intercourse with
supernatural beings, metamorphose themselves at will,
see into the future, and even control the elements. They
are potent to cure as well as to kill. For all complaints,
as usual, they 'put forth the charm of woven paces and
of waving hands,' and in some cases add other remedies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
For internal complaints they prescribe cold baths;
wounds and sores are treated with lotions and poultices
of crushed herbs, such as sage and rosemary, and of a
kind of black oily resin, extracted from certain seeds.
Other maladies they affirm to be caused by small pieces
of wood, stone, or other hard substance, which by some
means have entered the flesh, and which they pretend to
extract by sucking the affected part. In a case of paralysis
the stricken parts were whipped with nettles.
Blisters are raised by means of dry paste made from
nettle-stalks, placed on the bare flesh of the patient, set
on fire, and allowed to burn out. Cold water or an
emetic is used for fever and like diseases, or, sometimes,
the sufferer is placed naked upon dry sand or ashes, with
a fire close to his feet, and a bowl of water or gruel at
his head, and there left for nature to take its course,
while his friends and relatives sit round and howl him
into life or into eternity. Snake-bites are cured by an
internal dose of ashes, or the dust found at the bottom
of ants' nests, and an external application of herbs.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
The medicine-men fare better here than their northern
brethren, as, in the event of the non-recovery of their
patient, the death of the latter is attributed to the just
anger of their god, and consequently the physician is
not held responsible. To avert the displeasure of the
divinity, and to counteract the evil influence of the sorcerers,
regular dances of propitiation or deprecation are
held, in which the whole tribe join.<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DEATH AND BURIAL.</p>

<p>The temescal, or sweat-house, is the same here as elsewhere,
which renders a description unnecessary.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
dead were either burned or buried. Father Boscana
says that no particular ceremonies were observed during
the burning of the corpse. The body was allowed to lie
untouched some days after death, in order to be certain
that no spark of life remained. It was then borne out
and laid upon the funeral pyre, which was ignited by a
person specially appointed for that purpose. Everything
belonging to the deceased was burned with him. When
all was over the mourners betook themselves to the outskirts
of the village, and there gave vent to their lamentation
for the space of three days and nights. During
this period songs were sung, in which the cause of the
late death was related, and even the progress of the
disease which brought him to his grave minutely described
in all its stages. As an emblem of grief the
hair was cut short in proportion to nearness of relation
to or affection for the deceased, but laceration was not
resorted to.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Mr Taylor relates that the Santa Inez
Indians buried their dead in regular cemeteries. The
body was placed in a sitting posture in a box made of
slabs of claystone, and interred with all the effects of
the dead person.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> According to Reid, the natives of Los
Angeles County waited until the body began to show
signs of decay and then bound it together in the shape of a
ball, and buried it in a place set apart for that purpose, with
offerings of seeds contributed by the family. At the first
news of his death all the relatives of the deceased gathered
together, and mourned his departure with groans,
each having a groan peculiar to himself. The dirge was
presently changed to a song, in which all united, while
an accompaniment was whistled through a deer's leg-bone.
The dancing consisted merely in a monotonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
shuffling of the feet.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Pedro Fages thus describes a
burial ceremony at the place named by him Sitio de los
Pedernales.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Immediately after an Indian has breathed
his last, the corpse is borne out and placed before the
idol which stands in the village, there it is watched by
persons who pass the night round a large fire built for
the purpose; the following morning all the inhabitants
of the place gather about the idol and the ceremony
commences. At the head of the procession marches one
smoking gravely from a large stone pipe; followed by
three others, he three times walks round the idol and
the corpse; each time the head of the deceased is passed
the coverings are lifted, and he who holds the pipe blows
three puffs of smoke upon the body. When the feet are
reached, a kind of prayer is chanted in chorus, and the
parents and relatives of the defunct advance in succession
and offer to the priest a string of threaded seeds,
about a fathom long; all present then unite in loud cries
and groans, while the four, taking the corpse upon their
shoulders, proceed with it to the place of interment.
Care is taken to place near the body articles which have
been manufactured by the deceased during his life-time.
A spear or javelin, painted in various vivid colors, is
planted erect over the tomb, and articles indicating the
occupation of the dead are placed at his foot; if the deceased
be a woman, baskets or mats of her manufacture
are hung on the javelin.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>Death they believed to be a real though invisible being,
who gratified his own anger and malice by slowly
taking away the breath of his victim until finally life
was extinguished. The future abode of good spirits resembled
the Scandinavian Valhalla; there, in the dwelling-place
of their god, they would live for ever and ever,
eating, and drinking, and dancing, and having wives in
abundance. As their ideas of reward in the next world
were matter-of-fact and material, so were their fears of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
punishment in this life; all accidents, such as broken
limbs or bereavement by death, were attributed to the
direct vengeance of their god, for crimes which they
had committed.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>Though good-natured and inordinately fond of amusement,
they are treacherous and unreliable. Under a
grave and composed exterior they conceal their thoughts
and character so well as to defy interpretation. And
this is why we find men, who have lived among them
for years, unable to foretell their probable action under
any given circumstances.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SHOSHONE FAMILY.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Shoshone Family</span>, which forms the fourth and
last division of the Californian group, may be said to
consist of two great nations, the Snakes, or Shoshones
proper, and the Utahs. The former inhabit south-eastern
Oregon, Idaho, western Montana, and the northern
portions of Utah and Nevada, are subdivided into
several small tribes, and include the more considerable
nation of the Bannacks. The Utahs occupy nearly the
whole of Utah and Nevada, and extend into Arizona
and California, on each side of the Colorado. Among
the many tribes into which the Utahs are divided may
be mentioned the <i>Utahs</i> proper, whose territory covers
a great part of Utah and eastern Nevada; the <i>Washoes</i>
along the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada, between
Honey Lake and the west fork of Walker River; the
<i>Pah Utes</i>, or, as they are sometimes called, Piutes, in
western and central Nevada, stretching into Arizona
and south-eastern California; the <i>Pah Vants</i> in the vicinity
of Sevier Lake, the <i>Pi Edes</i> south of them, and the
<i>Gosh Utes</i>, a mixed tribe of Snakes and Utahs, dwelling
in the vicinity of Gosh Ute Lake and Mountains.</p>

<p>The Shoshones<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> are below the medium stature; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Utahs, though more powerfully built than the Snakes,
are coarser-featured and less agile. All are of a dark
bronze-color when free from paint and dirt, and, as usual,
beardless. The women are clumsily made, although
some of them have good hands and feet.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>On the barren plains of Nevada, where there is no
large game, the rabbit furnishes nearly the only clothing.
The skins are sewn together in the form of a cloak, which
is thrown over the shoulders, or tied about the body with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
thongs of the same. In warm weather, or when they
cannot obtain rabbit-skins, men, women and children
are, for the most part, in a state of nudity. The hair
is generally allowed to grow long, and to flow loosely
over the shoulders; sometimes it is cut straight over the
forehead, and among the Utahs of New Mexico it is
plaited into two long queues by the men, and worn short
by the women. Ornaments are rare; I find mention in
two instances<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> of a nose-ornament, worn by the Pah
Utes, consisting of a slender piece of bone, several
inches in length, thrust through the septum of the nose.
Tattooing is not practiced but paint of all colors is used
unsparingly.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>The Snakes are better dressed than the Utahs, their
clothing being made from the skins of larger game, and
ornamented with beads, shells, fringes, feathers, and,
since their acquaintance with the whites, with pieces of
brilliant-colored cloth. A common costume is a shirt,
leggins, and moccasins, all of buck-skin, over which is
thrown, in cold weather, a heavy robe, generally of buffalo-skin,
but sometimes of wolf, deer, elk, or beaver.
The dress of the women differs but little from that of the
men, except that it is less ornamented and the shirt is
longer.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS OF THE SNAKES.</p>

<p>The dress of the Snakes seen by captains Lewis and
Clarke was richer than is usually worn by them now; it
was composed of a robe, short cloak, shirt, long leggins,
and moccasins.</p>

<p>The robe was of buffalo or smaller skins, dressed with
the hair on; the collar of the cloak, a strip of skin from
the back of the otter, the head being at one end and the
tail at the other. From this collar were suspended from
one hundred to two hundred and fifty ermine-skins,<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> or
rather strips from the back of the ermine, including the
head and tail; each of these strips was sewn round a cord of
twisted silk-grass, which tapered in thickness toward the
tail. The seams were concealed with a fringe of ermine-skin;
little tassels of white fur were also attached to each
tail, to show off its blackness to advantage. The collar
was further ornamented with shells of the pearl-oyster;
the shirt, made of the dressed hides of various kinds of
deer, was loose and reached half-way down the thigh;
the sleeves were open on the under side as low as the
elbow,&mdash;the edges being cut into a fringe from the elbow
to the wrist,&mdash;and they fitted close to the arm. The collar
was square, and cut into fringe, or adorned with the
tails of the animals which furnished the hide; the shirt
was garnished with fringes and stained porcupine-quills;
the leggins were made each from nearly an entire antelope-skin,
and reached from the ankle to the upper part
of the thigh. The hind legs of the skin were worn uppermost,
and tucked into the girdle; the neck, highly ornamented
with fringes and quills, trailed on the ground
behind the heel of the wearer; the side seams were
fringed, and for this purpose the scalps of fallen enemies
were frequently used.</p>

<p>The moccasins were also of dressed hide, without
the hair, except in winter, when buffalo-hide, with the
hair inside, answered the purpose. They were made
with a single seam on the outside edge, and were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
embellished with quills; sometimes they were covered
with the skin of a polecat, the tail of which dragged behind
on the ground. Ear-ornaments of beads, necklaces
of shells, twisted-grass, elk-tushes, round bones,
like joints of a fish's back-bone, and the claws of the
brown bear, were all worn. Eagles' feathers stuck in
the hair, or a strip of otter-skin tied round the head,
seem to have been the only head-dresses in use.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> This,
or something similar, was the dress only of the wealthy
and prosperous tribes. Like the Utahs, the Snakes paint
extensively, especially when intent upon war.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS AND FOOD OF THE SHOSHONES.</p>

<p>The Snakes also build better dwellings than the Utahs.
Long poles are leaned against each other in a circle, and
are then covered with skins, thus forming a conical tent.
A hole in the top, which can be closed in bad weather,
serves as chimney, and an opening at the bottom three
or four feet high, admits the occupants on pushing aside
a piece of hide stretched on a stick, which hangs over
the aperture as a door. These skin tents, as is necessary
to a nomadic people, are struck and pitched with very
little labor. When being moved from one place to another,
the skins are folded and packed on the ponies,
and the poles are hitched to each side of the animal by
one end, while the other drags. The habitations of the
people of Nevada and the greater part of Utah are very
primitive and consist of heaps of brush, under which
they crawl, or even of a mere shelter of bushes, semi-circular
in shape, roofless, and three or four feet high,
which serves only to break the force of the wind. Some
of them build absolutely no dwellings, but live in caves
and among the rocks, while others burrow like reptiles
in the ground. Farnham gives us a very doleful picture
of their condition; he says: "When the lizard, and snail,
and wild roots are buried in the snows of winter, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
are said to retire to the vicinity of timber, dig holes in
the form of ovens in the steep sides of the sand-hills,
and, having heated them to a certain degree, deposit
themselves in them, and sleep and fast till the weather
permits them to go abroad again for food. Persons who
have visited their haunts after a severe winter, have
found the ground around these family ovens strewn with
the unburied bodies of the dead, and others crawling
among them, who had various degrees of strength, from
a bare sufficiency to gasp in death, to those that crawled
upon their hands and feet, eating grass like cattle."<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
Naturally pusillanimous, weak in development, sunk below
the common baser passions of the savage, more improvident
than birds, more beastly than beasts, it may
be possible to conceive of a lower phase of humanity, but
I confess my inability to do so.</p>

<p>Pine-nuts, roots, berries, reptiles, insects, rats, mice,
and occasionally rabbits are the only food of the poorer
Shoshone tribes. Those living in the vicinity of streams
or lakes depend more or less for their subsistence upon
fish. The Snakes of Idaho and Oregon, and the tribes
occupying the more fertile parts of Utah, having abundance
of fish and game, live well the year round, but
the miserable root-eating people, partly owing to their
inherent improvidence, partly to the scantiness of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
food-supply, never store sufficient provision for the winter,
and consequently before the arrival of spring they
are invariably reduced to extreme destitution. To avoid
starvation they will eat dead bodies, and even kill their
children for food.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> A rat or a rabbit is prepared for eating
by singeing the hair, pressing the offal from the entrails
and cooking body and intestines together. Lizards,
snakes, grasshoppers, and ants are thrown alive into a dish
containing hot embers, and are tossed about until roasted;
they are then eaten dry or used to thicken soup. Grasshoppers,
seeds, and roots, are also gathered and cooked in
the same manner as by the nations already described.
The Gosh Utes take rabbits in nets made of flax-twine,
about three feet wide and of considerable length. A
fence of sage-brush is erected across the rabbit-paths, and
on this the net is hung. The rabbits in running quickly
along the trail become entangled in the meshes and are
taken before they can escape. Lizards are dragged from
their holes by means of a hooked stick. To catch ants
a piece of fresh hide or bark is placed upon the ant-hill;
this is soon covered by vast swarms of the insects, which
are then brushed off into a bag and kept there until dead,
when they are dried for future use. Among the hunting
tribes antelope are gradually closed in upon by a
circle of horsemen and beaten to death with clubs. They
are also stalked after the fashion of the Californians proper,
the hunter placing the head and horns of an antelope
or deer upon his own head and thus disguised approaching
within shooting distance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NATIVE FISH-WEIR.</p>

<p>Fish are killed with spears having movable heads,
which become detached when the game is struck, and
are also taken in nets made of rushes or twigs. In the
latter case a place is chosen where the river is crossed
by a bar, the net is then floated down the stream and
on reaching the bar both ends are drawn together. The
fish thus enclosed are taken from the circle by hand,
and the Shoshone as he takes each one, puts its head in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
his mouth and kills it with his teeth. Captain Clarke
describes an ingeniously constructed weir on Snake River,
where it was divided into four channels by three small
islands. Three of these channels were narrow "and
stopped by means of trees which were stretched across,
and supported by willow stakes, sufficiently near to prevent
the passage of the fish. About the centre of each
was placed a basket formed of willows, eighteen or twenty
feet in length, of a cylindrical form, and terminating in
a conic shape at its lower extremity; this was situated
with its mouth upwards, opposite to an aperture in the
weir. The main channel of the water was then conducted
to this weir, and as the fish entered it they were
so entangled with each other, that they could not move,
and were taken out by emptying the small end of the
willow basket. The weir in the main channel was
formed in a manner somewhat different; there were, in
fact two distinct weirs formed of poles and willow sticks
quite across the river, approaching each other obliquely
with an aperture in each side of the angle. This is
made by tying a number of poles together at the top, in
parcels of three, which were then set up in a triangular
form at the base, two of the poles being in the range desired
for the weir, and the third down the stream. To
these poles two ranges of other poles are next lashed
horizontally, with willow bark and withes, and willow
sticks joined in with these crosswise, so as to form a
kind of wicker-work from the bottom of the river to the
height of three or four feet above the surface of the
water. This is so thick as to prevent the fish from passing,
and even in some parts with the help of a little
gravel and some stone enables them to give any direction
which they wish to the water. These two weirs
being placed near to each other, one for the purpose of
catching the fish as they ascend, the other as they go
down the river, are provided with two baskets made in
the form already described, and which are placed at the
apertures of the weir."</p>

<p>For present consumption the fish are boiled in water-tight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
baskets by means of red-hot stones, or are broiled
on the embers; sometimes the bones are removed before
the fish is cooked; great quantities are also dried for
winter. Some few of the Utahs cultivate a little maize,
vegetables, and tobacco, and raise stock, but efforts at
agriculture are not general. The Snakes sometimes
accompany the more northern tribes into the country of
the Blackfeet, for the purpose of killing buffalo.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>In their persons, dwellings and habits, the Utahs are
filthy beyond description. Their bodies swarm with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
vermin which they catch and eat with relish. Some of
the Snakes are of a more cleanly disposition, but, generally
speaking, the whole Shoshone family is a remarkably
dirty one.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS OF THE SHOSHONES.</p>

<p>The bow and arrow are universally used by the Shoshones,
excepting only some of the most degraded root-eaters,
who are said to have no weapon, offensive or defensive,
save the club. The bow is made of cedar, pine,
or other wood, backed with sinew after the manner
already described, or, more rarely, of a piece of elk-horn.
The string is of sinew. The length of the bow varies.
According to Farnham, that used by the Pi Utes is six
feet long, while that of the Shoshones seen by Lewis and
Clark was only two and a half feet in length. The arrows
are from two to four feet, and are pointed with
obsidian, flint, or, among the lower tribes, by merely
hardening the tip with fire. Thirty or forty are usually
carried in a skin quiver, and two in the hand ready for
immediate use. Lances, which are used in some localities,
are pointed in the same manner as the arrows when
no iron can be procured. The Snakes have a kind of
mace or club, which they call a <i>poggamoggon</i>. It consists
of a heavy stone, sometimes wrapped in leather, attached
by a sinew thong about two inches in length, to
the end of a stout leather-covered handle, measuring
nearly two feet. A loop fastened to the end held in the
hand prevents the warrior from losing the weapon in the
fight, and allows him to hold the club in readiness while
he uses the bow and arrow.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> They also have a circular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
shield about two and a half feet in diameter, which is
considered a very important part of a warrior's equipment,
not so much from the fact that it is arrow-proof, as
from the peculiar virtues supposed to be given it by the
medicine-men. The manufacture of a shield is a season
of great rejoicing. It must be made from the entire
fresh hide of a male two-year-old buffalo, and the process
is as follows. A hole is dug in the ground and filled
with red-hot stones; upon these water is poured until a
thick steam arises. The hide is then stretched, by as
many as can take hold of it, over the hole, until the hair
can be removed with the hands and it shrinks to the
required size. It is then placed upon a prepared hide,
and pounded by the bare feet of all present, until
the ceremony is concluded. When the shield is completed,
it is supposed to render the bearer invulnerable.
Lewis and Clarke also make mention of a
species of defensive armor "something like a coat of
mail, which is formed by a great many folds of dressed
antelope skins, united by means of a mixture of glue and
sand. With this they cover their own bodies and those
of their horses, and find it impervious to the arrow."
I find mention in one instance only, of a shield being
used by the Utahs. In that case it was small, circular,
and worn suspended from the neck. The fishing spear
I have already described as being a long pole with an
elk-horn point. When a fish is struck the shaft is
loosened from its socket in the head, but remains connected
with the latter by a cord.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Arrows are occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
poisoned by plunging them into a liver which has
been previously bitten by a rattlesnake.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MANNER OF MAKING WAR.</p>

<p>The tribes that possess horses always fight mounted,
and manage their animals with considerable address.
In war they place their reliance upon strategy and surprise;
fires upon the hills give warning of an enemy's
approach. Prisoners of war are killed with great tortures,
especially female captives, who are given over to the
women of the victorious tribe and by them done to death
most cruelly; it is said, however, that male prisoners
who have distinguished themselves by their prowess in
battle, are frequently dismissed unhurt. Scalps are taken,
and sometimes portions of the flesh of a brave fallen
enemy are eaten that the eater may become endued with
the valor of the slain. He who takes the most scalps
gains the most glory. Whether the warriors who furnished
the trophies fell by the hand of the accumulator
or not, is immaterial; he has but to show the spoils and
his fame is established. The Snakes are said to be peculiarly
skillful in eluding pursuit. When on foot,
they will crouch down in the long grass and remain
motionless while the pursuer passes within a few feet
of them, or when caught sight of they will double
and twist so that it is impossible to catch them. The
custom of ratifying a peace treaty by a grand smoke,
common to so many of the North American aborigines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
is observed by the Shoshones.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> The pipe, the bowl of
which is usually of red stone, painted or carved with
various figures and adorned with feathers, is solemnly
passed from mouth to mouth, each smoker blowing the
smoke in certain directions and muttering vows at the
same time.</p>

<p>The only tools used before iron and steel were introduced
by the whites were of flint, bone, or horn. The
flint knife had no regular form, and had a sharp edge
about three or four inches long, which was renewed when
it became dull. Elk-horn hatchets, or rather wedges,
were used to fell trees. They made water-proof baskets
of plaited grass, and others of wicker-work covered with
hide. The Snakes and some of the Utahs were versed
in the art of pottery, and made very good vessels from
baked clay. These were not merely open dishes, but
often took the form of jars with narrow necks, having
stoppers.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">LAWS AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Boats, as a rule, the Shoshones have none. They
usually cross rivers by fording; otherwise they swim, or
pass over on a clumsy and dangerous raft made of
branches and rushes.<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> By way of compensation they
all, except the poorest, have horses, and these constitute
their wealth. They have no regular currency, but use
for purposes of barter their stock of dried fish, their
horses, or whatever skins and furs they may possess.
They are very deliberate traders, and a solemn smoke
must invariably precede a bargain.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Although each
tribe has an ostensible chief, his power is limited to giving
advice, and although his opinion may influence the
tribe, yet he cannot compel obedience to his wishes.
Every man does as he likes. Private revenge, of course,
occasionally overtakes the murderer, or, if the sympathies
of the tribe be with the murdered man, he may
possibly be publicly executed, but there are no fixed
laws for such cases. Chieftainship is hereditary in some
tribes; in others it is derived from prestige.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>The Utahs do not hesitate to sell their wives and children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
into slavery for a few trinkets. Great numbers of
these unfortunates are sold to the Navajos for blankets.
An act which passed the legislature of Utah in 1852,
legalizing slavery, sets forth that from time immemorial,
slavery has been a customary traffic among the Indians;
that it was a common practice among them to gamble
away their wives and children into slavery, to sell them
into slavery to other nations, and that slaves thus obtained
were most barbarously treated by their masters;
that they were packed from place to place on mules;
that these unfortunate humans were staked out to grass
and roots like cattle, their limbs mutilated and swollen
from being bound with thongs; that they were frozen,
starved, and killed by their inhuman owners; that families
and tribes living at peace would steal each other's
wives and children, and sell them as slaves. In view
of these abuses it was made lawful for a probate judge,
or selectmen, to bind out native captive women and children
to suitable white persons for a term not to exceed
twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Polygamy, though common, is not universal; a wife
is generally bought of her parents;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> girls are frequently
betrothed in infancy; a husband will prostitute his wife
to a stranger for a trifling present, but should she be
unfaithful without his consent, her life must pay the
forfeit. The women, as usual, suffer very little from the
pains of child-bearing. When the time of a Shoshone
woman's confinement draws near, she retires to some
secluded place, brings forth unassisted, and remains there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
for about a month, alone, and procuring her subsistence
as best she can. When the appointed time has elapsed
she is considered purified and allowed to join her friends
again. The weaker sex of course do the hardest labor,
and receive more blows than kind words for their pains.
These people, in common with most nomadic nations,
have the barbarous custom of abandoning the old and
infirm the moment they find them an incumbrance.
Lewis and Clarke state that children are never flogged,
as it is thought to break their spirit.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GAMBLING AND DRINKING.</p>

<p>The games of hazard played by the Shoshones differ
little from those of their neighbors; the principal one
appears to be the odd-and-even game so often mentioned;
but of late years they have nearly abandoned these, and
have taken to 'poker,' which they are said to play with
such adroitness as to beat a white man. With the voice
they imitate with great exactness the cries of birds and
beasts, and their concerts of this description, which generally
take place at midnight, are discordant beyond
measure. Though they manufacture no intoxicating
liquor themselves, they will drink the whisky of the
whites whenever opportunity offers. They smoke the
<i>kinikkinik</i> leaf when no tobacco can be procured from
the traders.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> In connection with their smoking they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
have many strange observances. When the pipe is
passed round at the solemnization of a treaty, or the
confirmation of a bargain, each smoker, on receiving it
from his neighbor, makes different motions with it; one
turns the pipe round before placing the stem to his lips;
another describes a semicircle with it; a third smokes
with the bowl in the air; a fourth with the bowl on the
ground, and so on through the whole company. All
this is done with a most grave and serious countenance,
which makes it the more ludicrous to the looker-on.
The Snakes, before smoking with a stranger, always draw
off their moccasins as a mark of respect. Any great
feat performed by a warrior, which adds to his reputation
and renown, such as scalping an enemy, or successfully
stealing his horses, is celebrated by a change of
name. Killing a grizzly bear also entitles him to this
honor, for it is considered a great feat to slay one of
these formidable animals, and only he who has performed
it is allowed to wear their highest insignia of glory, the
feet or claws of the victim. To bestow his name upon
a friend is the highest compliment that one man can
offer another.</p>

<p>The Snakes, and some of the Utahs, are skillful riders,
and possess good horses. Their horse-furniture is simple.
A horse-hair or raw-hide lariat is fastened round
the animal's neck; the bight is passed with a single half-hitch
round his lower jaw, and the other end is held in
the rider's hand; this serves as a bridle. When the
horse is turned loose, the lariat is loosened from his jaw
and allowed to trail from his neck. The old men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
the women have saddles similar to those used for packing
by the whites; they are a wooden frame made of
two pieces of thin board fitting close to the sides of the
horse, and held together by two cross-pieces, in shape
like the legs of an isosceles triangle. A piece of hide
is placed between this and the horse's back, and a robe
is thrown over the seat when it is ridden on. The
younger men use no saddle, except a small pad, girthed
on with a leather thong. When traveling they greatly
overload their horses. All the household goods and provisions
are packed upon the poor animal's back, and then
the women and children seat themselves upon the pile,
sometimes as many as four or five on one horse.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DISEASES AND BURIAL.</p>

<p>The poorer Utahs are very subject to various diseases,
owing to exposure in winter. They have few, if any,
efficient remedies. They dress wounds with pine-gum,
after squeezing out the blood. The Snakes are much
affected by rheumatism and consumption, caused chiefly
by their being almost constantly in the water fishing,
and by exposure. Syphilis has, of course, been extensively
introduced among all the tribes. A few plants
and herbs are used for medicinal purposes, and the medicine-men
practice their wonted mummeries, but what
particular means of cure they adopt is not stated by the
authorities. I find no mention of their having sweat-houses.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the disposal of the dead usage differs. In
some parts the body is burned, in others it is buried.
In either case the property of the deceased is destroyed
at his burial. His favorite horse, and, in some instances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
his favorite wife, are killed over his grave, that he may
not be alone in the spirit land. Laceration in token of
grief is universal, and the lamentations of the dead person's
relatives are heard for weeks after his death, and
are renewed at intervals for many months. Child-like
in this, they rush into extremes, and when not actually
engaged in shrieking and tearing their flesh, they appear
perfectly indifferent to their loss.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SHOSHONE CHARACTER.</p>

<p>The character of the better Shoshone tribes is not
much worse than that of the surrounding nations; they
are thieving, treacherous, cunning, moderately brave
after their fashion, fierce when fierceness will avail them
anything, and exceedingly cruel. Of the miserable root
and grass eating Shoshones, however, even this much
cannot be said. Those who have seen them unanimously
agree that they of all men are lowest. Lying
in a state of semi-torpor in holes in the ground during
the winter, and in spring crawling forth and eating grass
on their hands and knees, until able to regain their feet;
having no clothes, scarcely any cooked food, in many
instances no weapons, with merely a few vague imaginings
for religion, living in the utmost squalor and filth,
putting no bridle on their passions, there is surely room
for no missing link between them and brutes.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Yet as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
in all men there stands out some prominent good, so
in these, the lowest of humanity, there is one virtue:
they are lovers of their country; lovers, not of fair hills
and fertile valleys, but of inhospitable mountains and
barren plains; these reptile-like men love their miserable
burrowing-places better than all the comforts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
civilization; indeed, in many instances, when detained
by force among the whites, they have been known to
pine away and die.</p>

<h4><a name="TRIBAL_IV" id="TRIBAL_IV"></a>TRIBAL BOUNDARIES.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">NORTHERN CALIFORNIANS.</p>

<div class="tribal">
<p>To the <span class="smcap">Northern Californians</span>, whose territory extends from Rogue
River on the north to Eel River south, and from the Pacific Ocean to the
Californian boundary east, including the Klamath, and other lakes, are assigned,
according to the authorities, the following tribal boundaries: There
are 'the Hoopahs, and the Ukiahs of Mendocino;' 'the Umpquas, Kowooses
or Cooses, Macanootoony's of the Umpqua river section, Nomee Cults, and
Nomee Lacks of Tehama County; the Copahs, Hanags, Yatuckets, Terwars
and Tolowas, of the lower Klamath river; the Wylaks and Noobimucks of
Trinity county mountains west from Sacramento plains; the Modocs of
Klamath Lake, the Ylackas of Pitt River, the Ukas and Shastas of Shasta
county.' <i>Taylor</i>, in <i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>June 8, 1860</i>.</p>

<p>'The <i>Tototins</i> are divided into twelve bands; eight of them are located
on the coast, one on the forks of the Coquille, and three on Rogue river.'
'The Tototins, from whom is derived the generic name of the whole people
speaking the language, reside on the north bank of the Tototin river, about
four miles from its mouth. Their country extends from the eastern boundary
of the Yahshutes, a short distance below their village, up the stream
about six miles, where the fishing-grounds of the Mackanotins commence.'
'The country of the Euquachees commences at the "Three Sisters," and
extends along the coast to a point about three miles to the south of their
village, which is on a stream which bears their name. The mining town
of Elizabeth is about the southern boundary of the Euquachees, and is
called thirty miles from Port Orford. Next southward of the Euquachees
are the Yahshutes, whose villages occupy both banks of the Tototin or Rogue
river, at its mouth. These people claim but about two and a half miles back
from the coast, where the Tototin country commences. The Yahshutes claim
the coast to some remarkable headlands, about six miles south of Rogue
river. South of these headlands are the Chetlessentuns. Their village is
north of, but near, the mouth of a stream bearing their name, but better
known to the whites as Pistol river. The Chetlessentuns claim but about
eight miles of the coast; but as the country east of them is uninhabited, like
others similarly situated, their lands are supposed to extend to the summit
of the mountains. Next to the Chetlessentuns on the south are the Wishtenatins,
whose village is at the mouth of a small creek bearing their name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
They claim the country to a small trading-post known as the Whale's Head,
about twenty-seven miles south of the mouth of Rogue River. Next in
order are the Cheattee or Chitco band, whose villages were situated on each
side of the mouth, and about six miles up a small river bearing their name....
The lands of these people extend from Whale's Head to the California
line, and back from the coast indefinitely.... The Mackanotin village is about
seven miles above that of the Tototins, and is on the same side of the river.
They claim about twelve miles of stream. The Shistakoostees succeed them
(the Mackanotins). Their village is on the north bank of Rogue river, nearly
opposite the confluence of the Illinois. These are the most easterly band
within my district in the South.' <i>Parrish</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1854, pp. 283-9.
'Dr. Hubbard, in his notes (1856) on the Indians of Rogue River and South

<p><i>Modoc</i>, by some <i>Moädoc</i>, is a word which originated with the Shasteecas,
who applied it indefinitely to all wild Indians or enemies. 'Their proper
habitat is on the southern shore of Lower Klamath Lake, on Hot Creek,
around Clear Lake, and along Lost River in Oregon.' <i>Powers</i>, in <i>Overland

<p>The <i>Klamaths</i> or <i>Lutuami</i>&mdash;'Lutuami, or Tlamatl, or Clamet Indians.
The first of these names is the proper designation of the people in their

Weitspeks call the river below Pohlik, signifying down; and that above
Pehtsik, or up; giving, moreover, the same name to the population in
speaking of them collectively. Three distinct tribes, speaking different
languages, occupy its banks between the sea and the mouth of the Shasté,
of which the lowest extends up to Bluff Creek, a few miles above the forks.
Of these there are, according to our information, in all, thirty-two villages....

Indians at the junction of Salmon and Klamath Rivers, Mr. Gibbs says:
'they do not seem to have any generic appellation for themselves, but apply
the terms "Kahruk," up, and "Youruk," down, to all who live above or
below themselves, without discrimination, in the same manner that the
others (at the junction of the Trinity) do "Pehtsik," and "Pohlik."' <i>Schoolcraft's

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Southern Californians</span>, whose territory lies south of the thirty-fifth
parallel, are, as far as is known, tribally distributed as follows:</p>

<p>The <i>Cahuillos</i> 'inhabit principally a tract of country about eighty miles
east from San Bernardino, and known as the Cabeson Valley, and their villages
are on or near the road leading to La Paz on the Colorado River....
Another branch of this tribe numbering about four hundred occupy a tract
of country lying in the mountains about forty miles southeast from San Bernardino,
known as the Coahuila Valley.' <i>Stanley</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, pp.
194-5. 'The Coahuillas are scattered through the San Bernardino and San
Jacinto Mountains and eastward in the Cabesan Valley.' <i>Whiting</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff.
Rept.</i>, 1871, p. 691. The Coahuilas live in the San Jacinto Mountains. <i>Parker</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 17. The Cohuillas reside in the northern half
of the country, commencing on the coast, and extending to within fifty miles
of the Colorado river, following the eastern base of the mountains. <i>San Francisco
Herald</i>, <i>June, 1853</i>. The Cahuillos or Cawios reside 'near the Pacific,
between the sources of the San Gabriel and Santa Anna.' <i>Ludewig's Ab. Lang.</i>,
p. 26. 'The Cahuillas are a little to the north of the San Luiseños, occupying
the mountain ridges and intervening valleys to the east and southeast of
Mount San Bernadino, down towards the Mohava river and the desert that
borders the river Colorado, the nation of Mohavas lying between them and
these rivers. I am unable just now to give the number and names of all their
villages. San Gorgonio, San Jacinto, Coyote, are among those best known,
though others even nearer the desert, are more populous.' <i>Hayes' MS.</i> The
Cohuillas occupy the southwestern part of San Bernardino County, and the
northwestern part of San Diego county. <i>MS. Map.</i> 'The Carvilla Indians
occupy the Country from San Gorgonio Pass to the Arroyo Blanco.' <i>Cram's
Topog. Memoir</i>, p. 119. 'The <i>Cowillers</i> and <i>Telemnies</i> live on Four Creeks.'

have been from the Feather river in the northern part of the State, to the
Tulare lakes of the south.' <i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>May 25, 1860</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Diegeños</i> 'are said to occupy the coast for some fifty miles above,
and about the same distance below San Diego, and to extend about a hundred
miles into the interior.' <i>Whipple, Ewbank, and Turner's Rept.</i>, in <i>Pac.
R. R. Rept.</i>, vol. iii. The Dieguinos are in the southern part of San Diego
County, and extend from the coast to the desert. <i>Henley</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>,
1856, p. 240. The Dieguinas reside in the southern part of the country
watered by the Colorado, and claim the land from a point on the Pacific to
the eastern part of the mountains impinging on the desert. <i>San Francisco
Herald</i>, <i>June, 1853</i>. The Comeyas or Diegenos 'occupy the coast for some
fifty miles above, and about the same distance below San Diego, and extend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
about a hundred miles into the interior.' <i>Bartlett's Pers. Nar.</i>, vol. ii., p. 7.
'The Indians round San Diego, Deguinos, Diegeños, were in a savage state,
and their language almost unknown. Bartlett says that they are also called
Comeya; but Whipple asserts that the Comeya, a tribe of the Yumas, speak
a different language.' <i>Ludewig</i>, <i>Ab. Lang.</i>, p. 62. On page 220 Ludewig says
that as the name Diegeños means the Indians round San Diego, there is no
such name as Deguinos. 'The villages of the Dieguinos, wherever they live
separately, are a little to the south of the Cahuillas. Indeed, under this
appellation they extend a hundred miles into Lower California, in about an
equal state of civilization, and thence are scattered through the Tecaté valley
over the entire desert on the west side of New River.... Their villages known
to me are San Dieguito (about twenty souls), San Diego Mission, San Pasqual,
Camajal (two villages), Santa Ysabel, San José, Matahuay, Lorenzo,
San Felipe, Cajon, Cuyamaca, Valle de las Viejas.' <i>Hayes' MS.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Missouris</i> 'are scattered over San Bernardino, San Diego and other
counties in the southern part of the State.' <i>Parker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869,
p. 17.</p>

<p>The <i>Kechi</i> inhabit the country about Mission San Luis Rey. <i>Bartlett's
Pers. Nar.</i>, vol. ii., p. 92.</p>

<p>The <i>Chumas</i>, or <i>Kachumas</i> live three miles from the Mission of Santa
Inez. <i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>Oct. 18, 1861</i>.</p>

<p><i>Los Cayotes</i> was the name given by the Spaniards to the tribe which originally
inhabited San Diego county. <i>Hoffman</i>, in <i>San Francisco Medical Press</i>,
vol. v., p. 147.</p>

<p>The <i>New River Indians</i> 'live along New River, sixty miles west from Fort
Yuma, and near San Diego.' <i>Jones</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 216.</p>

<p>The <i>Sierras</i>, or Caruanas, the <i>Lagunas</i>, or Tataguas, and the <i>Surillos</i> or
Cartakas are mentioned as living on the Tejon reservation. <i>Wentworth</i>, in

<p>Mr Taylor claims to have discovered the exact positions of many of the
places mentioned. His statement, for the accuracy of which I by no means
vouch, is as follows: 'Xucu, or Shucu, on the Ortega farm, near Rincon

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Shoshones</span>, whose territory spreads over south-eastern Oregon, southern
Idaho, and the whole of Utah and Nevada, extending into Arizona and
New Mexico, and the eastern border of California, I divide into two great
nations, the Snakes or Shoshones, proper, and the Utahs, with their subdivisions.
Wilson divides the Shoshones into the Shoshones and Bannacks,
and the Utahs; the latter he subdivides into seven bands, which will be seen
under Utahs. He adds: 'Among the Shoshonies there are only two bands
properly speaking. The principal or better portion are called Shoshonies,
or Snakes ... the others the Shoshocoes.... Their claim of boundary is to
the east, from the red Buttes on the North fork of the Platte, to its head in
the Park, Decayaque, or Buffalo Bull-pen, in the Rocky Mountains; to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
south across the mountains, over to the Yanpapa, till it enters Green, or
Colorado river, and then across to the backbone or ridge of mountains called
the Bear river mountains running nearly due west towards the Salt Lake, so
as to take in most of the Salt Lake, and thence on to the sinks of Marry's or
Humboldt's river; thence north to the fisheries, on the Snake river, in Oregon;
and thence south (their northern boundary), to the Red Buttes, including
the source of Green River.' <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. vi., p. 697. 'Under various
names ... the great race of Shoshones, is found scattered over the
boundless wilderness, from Texas to the Columbia. Their territory is bounded
on the north and west by ... the Blackfeet and Crows.' <i>Brownell's Ind.
Races</i>, pp. 537-8.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SNAKES.</p>

<p>The <i>Snakes</i>, or Shoshones proper, although they form a part only of the
great Shoshone family, are usually termed 'the Shoshones' by the authorities.
They are divided by Dr Hurt into 'Snakes, Bannacks, Tosiwitches, Gosha
Utes, and Cumumpahs, though he afterwards classes the last two divisions
as hybrid races between the Shoshones and the Utahs.... The Shoshones
claim the northeastern portion of the territory for about four hundred
miles west, and from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five miles
south from the Oregon line.' <i>Simpson's Route to Cal.</i>, p. 46. 'The great
Snake nation may be divided into three divisions, namely, the Shirrydikas,
or dog-eaters; the Wararereekas, or fish-eaters; and the Banattees, or
robbers. But, as a nation, they all go by the general appellation of Shoshones,
or Snakes.... The Shirrydikas are the real Shoshones, and live in
the plains hunting the buffalo.' The country claimed by the Snake tribes
'is bounded on the east by the Rocky Mountains, on the south by the Spanish
waters; on the Pacific, or west side, by an imaginary line, beginning at
the west end, or spur, of the Blue Mountains, behind Fort Nez Percés, and
running parallel with the ocean to the height of land beyond the Umpqua
River, in about north lat. 41° (this line never approaches within 150 miles of
the Pacific); and on the north by another line, running due east from the said
spur of the Blue Mountains, and crossing the great south branch, or Lewis
River, at the Dalles, till it strikes the Rocky Mountains 200 miles north of the
three pilot knobs, or the place thereafter named the 'Valley of Troubles.''
<i>Ross' Fur Hunters</i>, vol. i., pp. 249, 251. 'They embrace all the territory of
the Great South Pass, between the Mississippi valley and the waters of the
Columbia.... Under the name of Yampatickara or Root-eaters and Bonacks
they occupy with the Utahs the vast elevated basin of the Great Salt Lake,
extending south and west to the borders of New Mexico and California.'
<i>Brownell's Ind. Races</i>, pp. 533-7, 540. 'The hunters report, that the proper
country of the Snakes is to the east of the Youta Lake, and north of the Snake
or Lewis river; but they are found in many detached places. The largest
band is located near Fort Boise, on the Snake river to the north of the Bonacks.'
<i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. iv., p. 501. The Shoshones
'occupy the centre and principal part of the great Basin.' <i>Taylor</i>, in <i>Cal.
Farmer</i>, <i>Oct. 18, 1861</i>. 'Inhabit that part of the Rocky Mountains which
lies on the Grand and Green River branches of the Colorado of the West,
the valley of Great Bear River, the habitable shores of the Great Salt Lake,
a considerable portion of country on Snake River above and below Fort Hall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
and a tract extending two or three hundred miles to the west of that post.'
<i>Farnham's Trav.</i>, p. 61. The Shoshones inhabit about one third of the territory
of Utah, living north of Salt Lake 'and on the line of the Humboldt
or Mary River, some 400 miles west and 100 to 125 south of the Oregon line.
The Yuta claim the rest of the territory between Kansas, the Sierra Nevada,
New Mexico and the Oregon frontier.' <i>Burton's City of the Saints</i>, p. 575.
'Les Soshonies, c'est-à-dire les déterreurs de racines, surnommés les Serpents,

the Shoshonees proper is south of Lewis or Snake River, and east of the Salt
Lake. There is, however one detached band, known as the Wihinasht, or
Western Snakes, near Fort Boirie, separated from the main body by the tribe
of Bonnaks.' <i>Hale's Ethnog.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. vi., p. 219. 'The Shoshones
are a small tribe of the nation called Snake Indians, a vague denomination,
which embraces at once the inhabitants of the southern part of the
Rocky mountains, and of the plains on each side.' <i>Lewis and Clarke's Trav.</i>,
p. 305. The Snakes or Shothoucs 'formerly occupied the whole of that
vast territory lying between the Rocky and the Blue Mountains, and extending
northward to the lower fork of the Columbia, and to the south as far as
the basin of the Great Salt Lake.' <i>Coke's Rocky Mts.</i>, p. 275. 'They occupy
southern and western Nevada.' <i>Parker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 18. 'They
inhabit the southern part of the Rocky Mountains and the plains on each side.'
<i>Bulfinch's Ogn.</i>, p. 124. 'They occupy all the country between the southern
branches of Lewis's river, extending from the Umatullum to the E. side of the
Stony Mountains, on the southern parts of Wallaumut river from about 40° to
47° N. Lat. A branch of this tribe reside ... in spring and summer on the W.

Missouri.' <i>Morse's Rept.</i>, p. 369. 'The Shoshones dwell between the Rocky
and blue mountain ranges.' <i>Nicolay's Ogn. Ter.</i>, p. 151. 'The aboriginees of
the Reese River country consist of the Shoshone nation, divided into many
subordinate tribes, each having a distinctive name, and occupying a tract of
country varying from 20 to 50 miles square. Their country is bordered on
the west by the Pi-Utes, the Edwards Creek mountains some 20 miles west
of Reese River, being the dividing line. On the east it extends to Ruby Valley,
where it joins on the territory of the Goshoots, the Bannocks being their
neighbors on the northeast.' <i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>June 26, 1863</i>. 'The Snake tribe,
inhabit the country bordering on Lewis and Bear Rivers, and their various
tributaries.' <i>Palmer's Jour.</i>, p. 43. 'The Snake Indians, who embrace many
tribes, inhabit a wide extent of country at the head of Snake River above
and below Fort Hall, and the vicinity of Great Bear River and Great Salt
Lake. They are a migratory race, and generally occupy the south-eastern

portion of Oregon.' <i>Dunn's Ogn.</i>, p. 325. The Shoshones inhabit the
great plains to the southward of the Lewis River. <i>Cox's Adven.</i>, vol. ii., p. 143.
The Shoshones occupy 'almost the whole eastern half of the State (Nevada).
The line separating them from the Pai-Utes on the east and south is not very
clearly defined.' <i>Parker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 114. 'The western bands
of Shoshones ... range from the Idaho boundary north, southward to the
thirty-eighth parallel; their western limit is the line passing through the
Sunatoya Mountains; their eastern limit Steptoe and Great Salt Lake Valleys.'
<i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1870, p. 95. The Snakes inhabit 'the plains of the Columbia
between the 43d and 44th degrees of latitude.' <i>Franchère's Nar.</i>, p. 150. The
Washakeeks or Green River Snakes inhabit the country drained by Green
River and its tributaries. The Tookarikkahs, or mountain sheep-eaters, 'occupy
the Salmon river country and the upper part of Snake River Valley,
and Coiners' Prairie, near the Boise mines.' These two bands are the genuine
Snakes; other inferior bands are the Hokandikahs or Salt Lake Diggers
who 'inhabit the region about the great lake.' The Aggitikkahs or Salmon-eaters
who 'occupy the region round about Salmon falls, on Snake
river.' <i>Stuart's Montana</i>, p. 80.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BANNACKS AND UTAHS.</p>

<p>'The <i>Bannacks</i>, who are generally classed with the Snakes, inhabit the
country south of here, (Powder River) in the vicinity of Harney lake.... The
Winnas band of Snakes inhabit the country north of Snake river, and are
found principally on the Bayette, Boise, and Sickley rivers.' <i>Kirkpatrick</i>, in
<i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1862, pp. 267-8. The Bonacks 'inhabit the country between
Fort Boise and Fort Hall.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. iv., p. 502.
They 'inhabit the southern borders of Oregon, along the old Humboldt River
emigrant road.' <i>Simpson's Route to Cal.</i>, p. 47. The Bonaks seem 'to embrace
Indian tribes inhabiting a large extent of country west of the Rocky Mountains.
As the name imports, it was undoubtedly given to that portion of Indians
who dig and live on the roots of the earth.' <i>Johnston</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's
Arch.</i>, vol. iv., p. 221. The Bonaks inhabit 'the banks of that part of Saptin
or Snake River which lies between the mouth of Boisais or Reeds River and
the Blue Mountains.' <i>Farnham's Trav.</i>, p. 76. The Bonax inhabit the
country west of the Lewis fork of the Columbia between the forty-second
and forty-fourth parallels. <i>Parker's Map.</i> The Bannacks range through
northern Nevada, and into Oregon and Idaho. <i>Parker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>,
1869, p. 18. They 'claim the southwestern portions of Montana as their
land.' <i>Sully</i>, in <i>Id.</i>, p. 289. 'This tribe occupies most of that portion of
Nevada north of the forty-first degree of north latitude, with the southeastern
corner of Oregon and the southwestern corner of Idaho.' <i>Parker</i>, in <i>Id.</i>,
1866, p. 114. The Bannocks drift 'from Boise City to the game country
northeast of Bozeman, Montana, and south as far as Fort Bridger, Wyoming
Territory ... traveling from Oregon to East of the Rocky Mountains.' <i>High</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1872, pp. 272-3.</p>

<p class="sidenote">UTAHS.</p>

<p>The <i>Utah</i> nation occupies all that portion of the territory assigned to the
Shoshone family lying south of the Snakes, between the country of the Californians
proper, and the Rocky Mountains. It is divided into several tribes,
the number varying with different authorities. Wilson divides the Utah nation
into seven tribes; viz., the 'Taos, Yampapas, Ewinte, Tenpenny Utahs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
Parant Utahs, Sampiches, Pahmetes.' <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. vi., p. 697.
'Besides the Parawat Yutas, the Yampas, 200-300 miles south, on the White
River; the Tebechya, or sun-hunters, about Tête de Biche, near Spanish
lands; and the Tash Yuta, near the Navajos; there are scatters of the nation
along the Californian road from Beaver Valley, along the Santa Clara, Virgen,
Las Vegas, and Muddy Rivers, to New Mexico.' <i>Burton's City of the Saints</i>,
p. 578. 'The tribes of Utah Territory are: Utahs at large, Pi Utahs, roving,
Uwinty Utahs, Utahs of Sampitch Valley, Utahs of Carson Valley, Utahs of
Lake Sevier and Walker River, Navahoes and Utahs of Grand River, Shoshonees,
or Snakes proper, Diggers on Humboldt River, Eutahs of New
Mexico.' <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. v., p. 498. The Utahs are composed of
several bands, the most important of which are the Timpanogs who 'range
through Utah valley and the mountains adjoining the valley on the east....
The Uintahs, the principal band of the Utahs, ... range through Uintah valley
and the Green River country.... The Pah Vants ... range through
Pah Vant and Sevier valleys and west to the White mountains.' <i>Irish</i>, in
<i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1865, p. 145. 'The Yutah nation is very numerous, and is
also made up of many bands, which are to be distinguished only by their
names.... Four of these bands called Noaches, Payuches, Tabiachis and
Sogup, are accustomed to occupy lands within the province of New Mexico,
or very near it, to the north and northeast.' <i>Whipple, Ewbank, &amp; Turner's
Rept.</i>, in <i>Pac. R. R. Rept.</i>, vol. iii. 'The Utahs are divided into three bands&mdash;Mohuaches,
Capotes, and Nomenuches or Poruches.' <i>Delgado</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff.
Rept.</i>, 1865, p. 163; see also pp. 17, 18. 'The Ute tribe Dr. Hurt divides into
the Pah Utahs, Tamp Pah-Utes, Cheveriches, Pah Vants, San Pitches, and
Pyedes. The Utahs proper inhabit the waters of Green River, south of Green
River Mountains, the Grand River and its tributaries and as far south as the
Navajo country. They also claim the country bordering on Utah Lake and
as far south as the Sevier Lake.' <i>Simpson's Route to Cal.</i>, p. 44. 'The Utahs
are a separate and distinct tribe of Indians, divided into six bands, each with a
head chief, as follows: The Menaches ... the Capotes ... the Tabe-naches ...
the Cibariches ... the Tempanahgoes ... the Piuchas.' <i>Graves</i>, in
<i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1854, p. 178. 'The Yutahs are subdivided into four great
bands: the Noaches, the Payuches (whom we believe to be identical with
the Paï Utahs), the Tabiachis, and the Sogups, who live in perfect harmony
on the north eastern confines of New Mexico, and at a distance of 500 miles
to the south of the great tribe of the Zuguaganas.' <i>Domenech's Deserts</i>, vol.
ii., p. 8. The Utes are 'those ... which inhabit the vicinity of the lakes
and streams and live chiefly on fish, being distinguished by the name of Pah
Utahs or Pah Utes, the word Pah, in their language signifying water.' <i>Stansbury's
Rept.</i>, p. 148. 'The country of the Utaws is situated to the east and
southeast of the Soshonees, at the sources of the Rio Colorado.' <i>De Smet's
Letters</i>, p. 39. 'The Youtas live between the Snake and Green Rivers.' <i>Prichard's
Researches</i>, vol. v., p. 430. 'The Utahs of New Mexico are a portion of
the tribe of the same name inhabiting the Territory of Utah.... They inhabit
and claim all that region of country, embracing the sources of the north-western
tributaries of the Arkansas river, above Bent's fort, up to the southern
boundary of Utah Territory, and all the northern tributaries of the Rio

Grande, which lie within New Mexico and north of the 37th parallel of latitude.'
<i>Merriwether</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1854, p. 169. The Utes 'occupy and
claim that section of country ranging from Abiquin, northward to Navajo
River and westward somewhat of this line.' <i>Davis</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869,
p. 255. The Eutaws 'reside on both sides of the Eutaw or Anahuac mountains,
they are continually migrating from one side to the other.' <i>Farnham's
Trav.</i>, p. 48. 'The Youtas inhabit the country between the Snake and
Green rivers.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. iv., p. 502. 'The Utahs'
claim of boundaries are all south of that of the Shoshonies, embracing the
waters of the Colorado, going most probably to the Gulf of California.'
<i>Wilson</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. vi., p. 698. The country of the Utaws 'is
situated to the east and southeast of the Shoshones, about the Salt Lake, and
on the head waters of the Colorado river, which empties into the gulf of
California.... Their country being in latitude about 41°.' 'The Utaws are
decent in appearance and their country, which is towards Santa Fe, is said
to be tolerably good.' <i>Parker's Explor. Tour</i>, pp. 79, 309. The Yutas, Utaws,
or Youtas, 'range between lat. 35° and 42° North and the Meridians 29° and
37° W. Long. of Washington. The great Yutas tribe is divided into two families
which are contradistinguished by the names of their respective head-quarters;
the Tao Yutas, so called because their principal camp is pitched in
Tao mountains, seventy miles north of Santa Fé; and the Timpanigos Yutas,
who hold their great camp near the Timpanigos lake.' <i>Farnham's Life in Cal.</i>,

one of the most extensive nations of the West, being scattered from the north
of New Mexico to the borders of Snake river and Rio Colorado.' <i>Gregg's
Com. Prairies</i>, vol. i., p. 300.</p>

<p>The <i>Pah Utes</i> occupy the greater part of Nevada, and extend southward
into Arizona and south-eastern California. There is reason to believe that
the Pi Utes are a distinct tribe from the Pah Utes, but as the same localities
are frequently assigned to both tribes by different writers, and as many have
evidently thought them one and the same, thereby causing great confusion,
I have thought it best to merely give the names as spelled by the authorities
without attempting to decide which tribe is being spoken of in either case.
The Pah-Utes 'range principally in the southwestern portion of Utah and
the southeastern portion of Nevada.' <i>Head</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 124.
The Pah Utes 'are spread over the vast tract of territory, between the Sierra
Nevada and the Colorado River, going as far south as the thirty-fifth parallel,
and extending to the northward through California and Nevada into Southern
Oregon and Idaho.' <i>Colyer</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 92. The Pah-Utes
inhabit the western part of Nevada. <i>Walker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1872, p. 59.
The Pah Utes and Pah Edes range over all that part of Utah south of the city of
Filmore in Millard County. <i>Head</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1868, p. 150. 'The term
Pah Utes is applied to a very large number of Indians who roam through
that vast section of country lying between the Sierra Nevada and the Colorado,

going as far south as the thirty-fifth parallel, and extending to the
northward through California, Nevada, into Southern Oregon and Idaho.
The Indians of this tribe in Arizona are located in the Big Bend of the Colorado,
on both sides of the river, and range as far east as Diamond River,
west to the Sierra Nevada, and northward into the State of Nevada.' <i>Jones</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 216. The Pah Utes 'properly belong in Nevada
and Arizona, but range over in southwestern Utah.' <i>Irish</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>,
1865, p. 146. The Pah-Utes 'range principally from the borders of Oregon,
on the north, to the southeast boundary of Nevada, and from the Sierra
Nevada eastward to the Humboldt River and Sink of Carson; there are one or
two small bands of them still further east, near Austin, Nevada. They are
much scattered within these limits.' <i>Douglas</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1870, pp.
94-5. 'The Pah-utes roam along the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada,
from the mouth of the Virgin with the Colorado (in about lat. 36° long. 115°)
to the territories of the Washoes north, and as far east as the Sevier Lake
country of Fremont's explorations.' <i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>June 22, 1860</i>. 'The Pa-utahs,
and Lake Utahs occupy the territory lying south of the Snakes, and
upon the waters of the Colorado of the west and south of the Great Salt
Lake.' <i>Scenes in the Rocky Mts.</i>, p. 179. The Pá Yuta (Pey Utes) 'extend
from forty miles west of Stony Point to the Californian line, and N.W. to the
Oregon line, and inhabit the valley of the Fenelon River, which rising from
Lake Bigler empties itself into Pyramid Lake.' <i>Burton's City of the Saints</i>, p.
576. 'The Womenunche (also known as the Pa Uches) occupy the country
on the San Juan river.' <i>Collins</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1862, p. 238. 'The custom
of designating the different bands of Pah Utes is derived from the name of
some article of food not common in other localities; "Ocki," signifies "trout,"
"toy," "tule," &amp;c. The Ocki Pah Utes ... are located on Walker River and
Lake, and the mountains adjacent thereto. The Cozaby Pah Utes ... range
from Mono Lake east to Smoky Valley.' <i>Campbell</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1870,
pp. 112-13. The Pah Utes extend, 'over portions of Utah and Arizona Territories,
also the States of Nevada and California. <i>Fenton</i>, in <i>Id.</i>, p. 113.</p>

<p>The Chemehuevis are a band of Pah-Utahs. <i>Whipple, Ewbank, and Turner's
Rept.</i>, in <i>Pac. R. R. Rept.</i>, vol. iii., p. 76. The Chimehuevais live about forty miles
below the Colorado River agency, on the California side of the river, and are
scattered over an area of fifty square miles. <i>Tonner</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1872, p.
323. The Chemehuewas are 'located mainly on the west bank of the Colorado,
above La Paz, and ranges along the river from about thirty miles south of
Fort Mohave, to a point fifty miles north of Fort Yuma, to the eastward, but
a short distance.' <i>Sherman</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 216. The Chemehuevis
live on the Colorado river, above the Bill Williams fork, a small tribe and
quite unknown. <i>Poston</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1863, p. 387. The Chemehuevis
are 'a band of Pahutahs, ... belonging to the great Shoshonee family.'
<i>Ludewig's Ab. Lang.</i>, p. 35. 'The Chimchinves are undoubtedly a branch of
the Pah Ute tribe.' <i>Stanley</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 102.</p>

by the Piutes 'is about one hundred miles broad, and is bounded on the
north by the country of the Bannocks, on the east by that of the Shoshones,
on the south by the State line between Nevada and California and on the
west by the territory of the Washoes.' <i>Parker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 115.
The Piutes inhabit 'a country two hundred miles long by one hundred and
twenty broad, lying parallel and east of that of the Washoes.... South of
Walker lake are the Mono Pi Utes.... They are closely allied to the Walker
River or Ocki Pi Utes ... located in the vicinity of Walker river and lake and
Carson river and Upper lake.... At the lower Carson lake are the Toy Pi
Utes.' <i>Campbell</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 119. 'Upon the Colorado river,
in the northern part of the Territory lives a band, or some bands, of Pi Utes,
occupying both sides of the river, roaming to the limit of Arizona on the
west, but on the east, for some miles, how far cannot be determined.' <i>Whittier</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1868, p. 140. The Pi Ute 'range extends north to the
Beaver, south to Fort Mojave, east to the Little Colorado and San Francisco
Mountains, and on the west through the southern part of Nevada as far as
the California line ... the larger portion living in Nevada.' <i>Fenton</i>, in <i>Ind.
Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 203. The Pi Utes inhabit the south-west portion of Utah.

Utah.' <i>Powell</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1871, p. 562. The Pi Utes inhabit the
south-eastern part of Nevada. <i>Walker</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1872, p. 59.</p>

<p>The <i>Gosh Utes</i> inhabit the country west of Great Salt Lake, and extend to
the Pah Utes. They are said by most writers to be of mixed breed, between
the Snakes, or Shoshones proper, and the Utahs: 'The Goshautes
live about forty miles west' of Salt Lake City. <i>Forney</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>,
1858, p. 212. The Goships, or Gosha Utes, range west of Salt Lake. <i>Cooley</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1865, p. 17. The Goships 'range between the Great Salt
Lake and the land of the western Shoshones.' <i>Head</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1866,
p. 123. The Goship Shoshones 'live in the western part of Utah, between
Great Salt Lake and the western boundary of the Territory,' (Utah). <i>Tourtellotte</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p. 230. The Goshutes are located 'in the
country in the vicinity of Egan Cañon.... In the Shoshone range.' <i>Douglas</i>,
in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1870, p. 96. 'The Goship Shoshones inhabit that part of
Utah which lies between Great Salt Lake and the western boundary of the

classes among the Shoshones; but according to Mr. G. W. Bean, Capt.
Simpson's Guide in the fall of 1858 ... they are the offspring of a disaffected
portion of the Ute tribe, that left their nation, about two generations ago,
under their leader or Chief Goship, whence their name Goship Utes since
contracted into Goshutes.... Reside principally in the grassy valleys west of
Great Salt Lake, along and in the vicinity of Capt. Simpson's routes, as far
as the Ungoweah Range.' <i>Simpson's Route to Cal.</i>, pp. 47-8. The Gosh Yutas,
'a body of sixty under a peaceful leader were settled permanently on the
Indian Farm at Deep Creek, and the remainder wandered 40 to 200 miles
west of Gt. S. L. City.' <i>Burton's City of the Saints</i>, p. 577.</p>

<p>The <i>Toquimas</i> live about the head of Reese River Valley, and in the
country to the east of that point. <i>Taylor</i>, in <i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>June 26, 1863</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Temoksees</i> live about thirty miles south of Jacobsville. <i>Cal. Farmer</i>,

<p>The <i>Pah Vants</i> 'occupy the Corn Creek, Paravan, and Beaver Valleys, and
the valley of Sevier.' <i>Simpson's Route to Cal.</i>, p. 45. Half the Pavants 'are
settled on the Indian farm at Corn Creek; the other wing of the tribe lives
along Sevier Lake, and the surrounding country in the north-east extremity
of Filmore Valley, fifty miles from the City, where they join the Gosh Yuta.'
<i>Burton's City of the Saints</i>, p. 577. Although Mr Burton gives this as the
fruit of his own observation, it is evidently taken from <i>Forney's Rept.</i>, in
<i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1859, p. 364, which reads as follows: 'About half of them
(the Pahvants) have their home on the Corn Creek Indian farm. The other
wing of the tribe lives along Sevier lake and surrounding country, in the
northeast extremity of Fillmore valley, and about fifty miles from Fillmore
city.' The Pah Vants range 'through Pah-Vant and Sevier valleys, and
west to the White Mountains.' <i>Cooley</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1865, p. 17. 'The
Pahvents occupy the territory in the vicinity of Corn Creek reservation,
and south of the Goship Shoshones.' <i>Tourtellotte</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1869, p.

<p class="ch_summ">
<span class="smcap">Geographical Position of this Group, and Physical Features of the
Territory&mdash;Family Divisions: Apaches, Pueblos, Lower Californians,
and Northern Mexicans&mdash;the Apache Family: Comanches, Apaches

<p>The <span class="smcap">New Mexicans</span>, under which name I group the
nations of New Mexico, Arizona, Lower California, Sonora,
Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila, Nuevo
Leon, northern Zacatecas, and western Texas, present
some peculiarities not hitherto encountered in this work.
As a groupal designation, this name is neither more nor
less appropriate than some others; all I claim for it is
that it appears as fit as any. The term Mexican might
with propriety be applied to this group, as the majority
of its people live within the Mexican boundary, but that
word is employed in the next division, which is yet more
strictly of Mexico.</p>

<p>The territory of the New Mexicans, which lies for the
most part between the parallels 36° and 23° and the meridians
96° and 117°, presents a great diversity of climate
and aspect. On reaching the northern extremity of the
Gulf of California, the Sierra Nevada and coast ranges of
mountains join and break up into detached upheavals, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
as they are called 'lost mountains'; one part, with no great
elevation, continuing through the peninsula, another,
under the name of Sierra Madre, extending along the
western side of Mexico. The Rocky Mountains, which
separate into two ranges at about the forty-fifth parallel,
continue southward, one branch, known in Utah as
the Wahsatch, merging into the Sierra Madre, while
the other, the great Cordillera, stretches along the
eastern side of Mexico, uniting again with the Sierra
Madre in the Mexican table-land. Besides these are
many detached and intersecting ranges, between which
lie arid deserts, lava beds, and a few fertile valleys.
From the sterile sandy deserts which cover vast areas of
this territory, rise many isolated groups of almost inaccessible
peaks, some of which are wooded, thus affording
protection and food for man and beast. Two great
rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande del Norte flow
through this region, one on either side, but, except in
certain spots, they contribute little to the fertilization of
the country. In the more elevated parts the climate is
temperate, sometimes in winter severely cold; but on
the deserts and plains, with the scorching sun above and
the burning sand beneath, the heat is almost insupportable.
The scanty herbage, by which the greater part of
this region is covered, offers to man but a transient food-supply;
hence he must move from place to place or
starve. Thus nature, more than elsewhere on our coast,
invites to a roving life; and, as on the Arabian deserts,
bands of American Bedouins roam over immense tracts
seeking what they may devour. Here it is that many
a luckless miner and ill-protected traveler pays the penalty
of his temerity with his life; here it is, more than
elsewhere within the temperate zones of the two Americas,
that the natives bid defiance to the encroachments
of civilization. Sweeping down upon small settlements
and isolated parties, these American Arabs rob, murder,
and destroy, then fleeing to their strongholds bid defiance
to pursuers. In the midst of all this we find another
phenomenon in the semi-civilized towns-people of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
Mexico and Arizona; a spontaneous awakening from the
ruder phases of savagism.</p>

<p>The families of this division may be enumerated as
follows: The <i>Apaches</i>, under which general name I include
all the savage tribes roaming through New Mexico,
the north-western portion of Texas, a small part of northern
Mexico, and Arizona; the <i>Pueblos</i>, or partially cultivated
towns-people of New Mexico and Arizona, with
whom I unite, though not town-builders, the non-nomadic
Pimas, Maricopas and Pápagos of the lower Gila
River; the <i>Lower Californians</i>, who occupy the peninsula;
and the <i>Northern Mexicans</i>, which term includes the various
nations scattered over the States of Sonora, Sinaloa,
Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and northern
Zacatecas.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE APACHES.</p>

<p class="p2">To the <span class="smcap">Apaches</span>, using the term in the signification of
a family of this division, no accurate boundaries can be
assigned. Owing to their roving proclivities and incessant
raids they are led first in one direction and then
in another. In general terms they may be said to range
about as follows: The <i>Comanches</i>, Jetans, or Nauni,
consisting of three tribes, the Comanches proper, the
Yamparacks, and Tenawas, inhabiting northern Texas,
eastern Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Durango, and
portions of south-western New Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> by language
allied to the Shoshone family;<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> the <i>Apaches</i>, who call

themselves Shis Inday, or 'men of the woods,'<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> and whose
tribal divisions are the Chiricaguis, Coyoteros, Faraones,

of the Colorado in Mojave Valley; the <i>Hualapais</i>, near
the headwaters of Bill Williams Fork; the <i>Yumas</i>, on
the east bank of the Colorado, near its junction with
the Rio Gila;<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> the <i>Cosninos</i>, who like the Hualapais are
sometimes included in the Apache nation, ranging through

Williams Fork and the Rio Hassayampa.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Of the multitude
of names mentioned by the early Spanish authorities,
I only give in addition to the above the <i>Yalchedunes</i>,
located on the west bank of the Colorado in about
latitude 33° 20´, the <i>Yamajabs</i>, on the east bank of the
same river, in about latitude 34°-35°; the <i>Cochees</i>, in the
Chiricagui Mountains of Arizona, the <i>Cruzados</i><a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> in New
Mexico, and finally the <i>Nijoras</i>,<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> somewhere about the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span></p>

<p>The Apache country is probably the most desert of
all, alternating between sterile plains and wooded mountains,
interspersed with comparatively few rich valleys.
The rivers do little to fertilize the soil except in spots;
the little moisture that appears is quickly absorbed by
the cloudless air and arid plains which stretch out, sometimes
a hundred miles in length and breadth, like lakes
of sand. In both mountain and desert the fierce, rapacious
Apache, inured from childhood to hunger and
thirst, and heat and cold, finds safe retreat. It is here,
among our western nations, that we first encounter thieving
as a profession. No savage is fond of work; indeed,
labor and savagism are directly antagonistic, for
if the savage continues to labor he can but become civilized.
Now the Apache is not as lazy as some of his
northern brothers, yet he will not work, or if he does,
like the Pueblos who are nothing but partially reclaimed
Apaches or Comanches, he forthwith elevates himself,
and is no longer an Apache; but being somewhat free
from the vice of laziness, though subject in an eminent
degree to all other vices of which mankind have any
knowledge, he presents the anomaly of uniting activity
with barbarism, and for this he must thank his thievish
propensities. Leaving others to do the work, he cares
not whom, the agriculturists of the river-bottoms or the
towns-people of the north, he turns Ishmaelite, pounces
upon those near and more remote, and if pursued retreats
across the <i>jornadas del muerte</i>, or 'journeys of death' as
the Mexican calls them, and finds refuge in the gorges,
cañons, and other almost impregnable natural fortresses
of the mountains.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSIQUE OF APACHES.</p>

<p>The disparity in physical appearance between some of
these nations, which may be attributed for the most part
to diet, is curious. While those who subsist on mixed
vegetable and animal food, present a tall, healthy, and
muscular development, hardly excelled by the Caucasian
race, those that live on animal food, excepting perhaps
the Comanches, are small in stature, wrinkled, shriveled,
and hideously ugly.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> All the natives of this family,
with the exception of the Apaches proper, are tall, well-built,
with muscles strongly developed, pleasing features,
although at times rather broad faces, high foreheads,
large, clear, dark-colored eyes, possessing generally extraordinary
powers of vision, black coarse hair and, for
a wonder, beards. Taken as a whole, they are the most
perfect specimens of physical manhood that we have yet
encountered. While some, and particularly females, are
<span class="sidenote">PHYSICAL PECULIARITIES.</span>
a light copper color, others again approach near to the
dark Californian. Women are generally plumper, inclining
more to obesity than the men. Some comely girls
are spoken of amongst them, but they grow old early.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
In contradistinction to all this the Apaches proper, or
Apache nation, as we may call them, are slim, ill developed,
but very agile. Their height is about five feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
four to five inches; features described as ugly, repulsive,
emotionless, flat, and approaching the Mongol cast, while
the head is covered with an unkempt mass of coarse,
shocky, rusty black hair, not unlike bristles. The women
are not at all behind the men in ugliness, and a pleasing
face is a rarity. A feature common to the family is remarkably
small feet; in connection with which may be
mentioned the peculiarity which obtains on the lower
Colorado, of having the large toe widely separated from
the others, which arises probably from wading in marshy
bottoms. All the tribes whose principal subsistence is
meat, and more particularly those that eat horse and
mule flesh, are said to exhale a peculiar scent, something
like the animals themselves when heated.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS OF APACHES AND MOJAVES.</p>

<p>All the natives of this region wear the hair much in
the same manner, cut square across the forehead, and
flowing behind.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The Mojave men usually twist or plait
it, while with the women it is allowed to hang loose.
Tattooing is common, but not universal; many of the
Mojave women tattoo the chin in vertical lines like the
Central Californians, except that the lines are closer together.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
Paint is freely used among the Mojaves, black
and red predominating, but the Apaches, Yumas, and
others use a greater variety of colors.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Breech-cloth and
moccasins are the ordinary dress of the men,<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
women have a short petticoat of bark.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> The dress of
the Mojaves and Apaches is often more pretentious, being
a buckskin shirt, skull-cap or helmet, and moccasins of
the same material; the latter, broad at the toes, slightly
turned up, and reaching high up on the leg, serve as a
protection against cacti and thorns.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> It is a common
practice among these tribes to plaster the head and body
with mud, which acts as a preventive against vermin and
a protection from the sun's rays.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> In their selection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
of ornaments the Mojaves show a preference for white,
intermixed with blue; necklaces and bracelets made
from beads and small shells, usually strung together,
but sometimes sewed on to leather bands are much in
vogue. The Apache nation adopt a more fantastic style
in painting and in their head-dress; for ornament
they employ deer-hoofs, shells, fish-bones, beads, and
occasionally porcupine-quills, with which the women embroider
their short deer-skin petticoats.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The Navajoes,
both men and women, wear the hair long, tied or
clubbed up behind; they do not tattoo or disfigure
themselves with paint.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> The ordinary dress is a species
of hunting-shirt, or doublet, of deer-skin, or a blanket
confined at the waist by a belt; buckskin breeches, sometimes
ornamented up the seams with pieces of silver or
porcupine-quills; long moccasins, reaching well up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
leg, and a round helmet-shaped cap, also of buckskin,
surmounted with a plume of eagle or wild turkey feathers,
and fastened with a chin-strap. The women wear
a blanket and waist-belt, breeches and moccasins. The
belts, which are of buckskin, are frequently richly ornamented
with silver. They sometimes also use porcupine-quills,
with which they embroider their garments.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">COMANCHE DRESS AND ORNAMENT.</p>

<p>The Comanches of both sexes tattoo the face, and
body generally on the breast.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The men do not cut the
hair, but gather it into tufts or plaits, to which they
attach round pieces of silver graduated in size from top
to bottom; those who cannot obtain or afford silver use
beads, tin, or glass.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Much time is spent by them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
painting and adorning their person&mdash;red being a favorite
color; feathers also form a necessary adjunct to their
toilet.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Some few wear a deer-skin shirt, but the more
common dress is the buffalo-robe, which forms the sole
covering for the upper part of the body; in addition, the
breech-cloth, leggins, and moccasins are worn. The
women crop the hair short, and a long shirt made of
deer-skin, which extends from the neck to below the
knees, with leggins and moccasins, are their usual attire.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS OF THE APACHES.</p>

<p>Nomadic and roving in their habits, they pay little
attention to the construction of their dwellings. Seldom
do they remain more than a week in one locality;<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
hence their lodges are comfortless, and diversified in
style according to caprice and circumstances. The
frame-work everywhere is usually of poles, the Comanches
placing them erect, the Lipans bringing the tops
together in cone-shape, while the Apaches bend them
over into a low oval;<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> one or other of the above forms
is usually adopted by all this family,<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> with unimportant
differences depending on locality and variations of climate.
The framework is covered with brushwood or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
skins, sometimes with grass or flat stones. They are
from twelve to eighteen feet in diameter at the widest
part, and vary from four to eight feet in height,<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> which
is sometimes increased by excavation.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> A triangular
opening serves as a door, which is closed with a piece of
cloth or skin attached to the top.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> When on or near
rocky ground they live in caves, whence some travelers
have inferred that they build stone houses.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> A few of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
the Mojave dwellings are so superior to the others that
they deserve special notice. They may be described as
a sort of shed having perpendicular walls and sloping
roof, the latter supported by a horizontal beam running
along the center, the roof projecting in front so as to
form a kind of portico. The timber used is cottonwood,
and the interstices are filled up with mud or straw.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
None of their houses have windows, the door and smoke-hole
in the roof serving for this purpose; but, as many
of them have their fires outside, the door is often the
only opening.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NEW MEXICAN DWELLINGS.</p>

<p>Small huts about three feet in height constitute their
medicine-lodges, or bath-houses, and are generally in
form and material like their other structures.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> The
Mojaves also build granaries in a cylindrical form with
conical, skillfully made osier roofs.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.</p>

<p>The food of all is similar;<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> most of them make more
or less pretentions to agriculture, and are habituated to
a vegetable diet, but seldom do any of them raise a sufficient
supply for the year's consumption, and they are
therefore forced to rely on the mesquit-bean, the piñon-nut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
and the maguey-plant, <i>agave mexicana</i>, and other
wild fruits, which they collect in considerable quantities.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
They are but indifferent hunters, and secure
only a precarious supply of small game, such as rabbits
and squirrels, with ultimate recourse to rats, grasshoppers,
lizards and other reptiles.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> A few fish are taken
by those living in the neighborhood of rivers.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
Navajos, Mojaves, and Yumas, have long been acquainted
with the art of agriculture and grow corn,
beans, pumpkins, melons, and other vegetables, and also
some wheat; some attempt a system of irrigation, and
others select for their crops that portion of land which
has been overflowed by the river. The Navajos possess
numerous flocks of sheep, which though used for food,
they kill only when requiring the wool for blankets.
Although in later years they have cows, they do not
make butter or cheese, but only a curd from sour milk,
from which they express the whey and of which they
are very fond.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>Their method of planting is simple; with a short sharp-pointed
stick small holes are dug in the ground into
which they drop the seeds, and no further care is given
to the crop except to keep it partially free from weeds.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>Maize soaked in water is ground to a paste between
two stones. From this paste tortillas, or thin cakes, are
made which are baked on a hot stone. To cook the
maguey, a hole is made in the ground, in which a fire is
kindled; after it has burned some time the maguey-bulb
is buried in the hot ashes and roasted. Some concoct a
gypsy sort of dish or ollapodrida; game, and such roots
or herbs as they can collect, being put in an earthen pot
with water and boiled.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span></p>

<p>As before mentioned, the roving Apaches obtain most
of their food by hunting and plunder; they eat more
meat and less vegetable diet than the other Arizona
tribes. They have a great partiality for horse-flesh, seldom
eat fish, but kill deer and antelope.<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> When hunting
they frequently disguise themselves in a skin, and
imitating closely the habits and movements of the animal,
they contrive to approach within shooting-distance.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
Whether it be horse or deer, every portion of the carcass
with the exception of the bones, is consumed, the entrails
being a special delicacy. Their meat they roast partially
in the fire, and eat it generally half raw. When
food is plenty they eat ravenously and consume an enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
quantity; when scarce, they fast long and stoically.
Most of them hate bear-meat and pork. So Jew-like is
the Navajo in this particular that he will not touch pork
though starving.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BUFFALO HUNTING.</p>

<p>The Comanches do not cultivate the soil, but subsist
entirely by the chase. Buffalo, which range in immense
herds throughout their country, are the chief food, the
only addition to it being a few wild plants and roots;
hence they may be said to be almost wholly flesh-eaters.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
In pursuit of the buffalo they exhibit great activity,
skill, and daring. When approaching a herd, they advance
in close column, gradually increasing their speed,
and as the distance is lessened, they separate into two or
more groups, and dashing into the herd at full gallop,
discharge their arrows right and left with great rapidity;
others hunt buffalo with spears, but the common and
more fatal weapon is the bow and arrow. The skinning
and cutting up of the slain animals is usually the task
of the women.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> The meat and also the entrails are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
eaten both raw and roasted. A fire being made in a
hole, sticks are ranged round it, meeting at the top, on
which the meat is placed. The liver is a favorite morsel,
and is eaten raw; they also drink the warm blood of the
animal.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> No provision is made for a time of scarcity,
but when many buffalo are killed, they cut portions of
them into long strips, which, after being dried in the sun,
are pounded fine. This pemican they carry with them
in their hunting expeditions, and when unsuccessful in
the chase, a small quantity boiled in water or cooked
with grease, serves for a meal. When unable to procure
game, they sometimes kill their horses and mules for
food, but this only when compelled by necessity.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> In
common with all primitive humanity they are filthy&mdash;never
bathing except in summer<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>&mdash;with little or no
sense of decency.<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS.</p>

<p>Throughout Arizona and New Mexico, the bow and arrow
is the principal weapon, both in war and in the chase;
to which are added, by those accustomed to move about
on horseback, the shield and lance;<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> with such also the
Mexican riata may now occasionally be seen.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> In battle,
the Colorado River tribes use a club made of hard
heavy wood, having a large mallet-shaped head, with a
small handle, through which a hole is bored, and in
which a leather thong is introduced for the purpose of
securing it in the hand.<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> They seldom use the tomahawk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">BOW AND LANCE.</span>Some carry slings with four cords attached.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
The bows are made of yew, bois d'arc, or willow, and
strengthened by means of deer-sinews, firmly fastened
to the back with a strong adhesive mixture. The length
varies from four to five feet. The string is made from
sinews of the deer.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> A leathern arm-guard is worn
round the left wrist to defend it from the blow of the
string.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> The arrows measure from twenty to thirty
inches, according to length of bow, and the shaft is composed
of two pieces; the notch end, which is the longer,
consisting of a reed, into which is fitted a shorter piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
made of acacia, or some other hard wood, and tipped
with obsidian, agate, or iron. It is intended that when
an object is struck, and an attempt is made to draw out
the arrow, the pointed end shall remain in the wound.
There is some difference in the feathering; most nations
employing three feathers, tied round the shaft at equal
distances with fine tendons. The Tontos have their
arrows winged with four feathers, while some of the
Comanches use only two. All have some distinguishing
mark in their manner of winging, painting, or carving
on their arrows.<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> The quiver is usually made of
the skin of some animal, deer or sheep, sometimes of a
fox or wild-cat skin entire with the tail appended, or of
reeds, and carried slung at the back or fastened to a waist-belt.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>
The lance is from twelve to fifteen feet long, the
point being a long piece of iron, a knife or sword blade
socketed into the pole.<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Previous to the introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
of iron, their spears were pointed with obsidian or some
other flinty substance which was hammered and ground
to a sharp edge. The frame of the shield is made of
light basket-work, covered with two or three thicknesses
of buffalo-hide; between the layers of hide it is usual
with the Comanches to place a stuffing of hair, thus
rendering them almost bullet proof. Shields are painted
in various devices and decorated with feathers, pieces
of leather, and other finery, also with the scalps of
enemies, and are carried on the left arm by two straps.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">APACHE WARRIORS.</p>

<p>Their fighting has more the character of assassination
and murder than warfare. They attack only when
they consider success a foregone conclusion, and rather
than incur the risk of losing a warrior will for days lie
in ambush till a fair opportunity for surprising the foe
presents itself.<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> The ingenuity of the Apache in preparing
an ambush or a surprise is described by Colonel
Cremony as follows: "He has as perfect a knowledge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
the assimilation of colors as the most experienced Paris
modiste. By means of his acumen in this respect, he
can conceal his swart body amidst the green grass,
behind brown shrubs, or gray rocks, with so much address
and judgment that any but the experienced would
pass him by without detection at the distance of three or
four yards. Sometimes they will envelop themselves
in a gray blanket, and by an artistic sprinkling of earth,
will so resemble a granite boulder as to be passed within
near range without suspicion. At others, they will
cover their persons with freshly gathered grass, and lying
prostrate, appear as a natural portion of the field. Again
they will plant themselves among the Yuccas, and so
closely imitate the appearance of that tree as to pass for
one of its species."</p>

<p>Before undertaking a raid they secrete their families
in the mountain fastnesses, or elsewhere, then two by
two, or in greater numbers, they proceed by different
routes, to a place of rendezvous, not far from where the
assault is to be made or where the ambuscade is to be
prepared. When, after careful observation, coupled with
the report of their scouts, they are led to presume that
little, if any, resistance will be offered them, a sudden
assault is made, men, women and children are taken
captives, and animals and goods secured, after which
their retreat is conducted in an orderly and skillful
manner, choosing pathways over barren and rugged
mountains which are known only to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Held
asunder from congregating in large bodies by a meagerness
of provisions, they have recourse to a system of
signals which facilitates intercourse with each other.
During the day one or more columns of smoke are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
signals made for the scattered and roaming bands to
rendezvous, or they serve as a warning against approaching
danger. To the same end at night they used a fire
beacon; besides these, they have various other means of
telegraphing which are understood only by them, for
example, the displacement and arrangement of a few
stones on the trail, or a bended twig, is to them a note
of warning as efficient, as is the bugle-call to disciplined
troops.<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>They treat their prisoners cruelly; scalping them, or
burning them at the stake; yet, ruled as they are by
greediness, they are always ready to exchange them for
horses, blankets, beads, or other property. When hotly
pursued, they murder their male prisoners, preserving
only the females and children, and the captured cattle,
though under desperate circumstances they do not hesitate
to slaughter the latter.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The Apaches returning to
their families from a successful expedition, are received
by the women with songs and feasts, but if unsuccessful
they are met with jeers and insults. On such occasions
says Colonel Cremony, "the women turn away from them
with assured indifference and contempt. They are upbraided
as cowards, or for want of skill and tact, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
told that such men should not have wives, because they
do not know how to provide for their wants. When so
reproached, the warriors hang their heads and offer no
excuse for their failure. To do so would only subject
them to more ridicule and objurgation; but Indian-like,
they bide their time in the hope of finally making their
peace by some successful raid." If a Mojave is taken
prisoner he is forever discarded in his own nation, and
should he return his mother even will not own him.<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">COMANCHE WARRIORS.</p>

<p>The Comanches, who are better warriors than the
Apaches, highly honor bravery on the battle-field.
From early youth, they are taught the art of war, and the
skillful handling of their horses and weapons; and they
are not allowed a seat in the council, until their name
is garnished by some heroic deed.<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Before going on
the war-path they perform certain ceremonies, prominent
among which is the war-dance.<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> They invariably
fight on horseback with the bow and arrow, spear and
shield, and in the management of these weapons they
have no superiors.</p>

<p>Their mode of attack is sudden and impetuous; they
advance in column, and when near the enemy form subdivisions
charging on the foe simultaneously from opposite
sides, and while keeping their horses in constant
motion, they throw themselves over the side, leaving
only a small portion of the body exposed, and in this
position discharge their arrows over the back of the animal
or under his neck with great rapidity and precision.<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
A few scalps are taken, for the purpose of being used at
the war or scalp dance by which they celebrate a victory.
Prisoners belong to the captors and the males
are usually killed, but women are reserved and become
the wives or servants of their owners, while children of
both sexes are adopted into the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Peace ceremonies
take place at a council of warriors, when the pipe
is passed round and smoked by each, previous to which
an interchange of presents is customary.<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IMPLEMENTS.</p>

<p>Household utensils are made generally of wickerwork,
or straw, which, to render them watertight, are coated
with some resinous substance. The Mojaves and a few
of the Apache tribes have also burnt-clay vessels, such
as water-jars and dishes.<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> For grinding maize, as before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
stated, a kind of metate is used, which with them is
nothing more than a convex and a concave stone.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> Of
agricultural implements they know nothing; a pointed
stick, crooked at one end, which they call <i>kishishai</i>, does
service as a corn-planter in spring, and during the later
season answers also for plucking fruit from trees, and
again, in times of scarcity, to dig rats and prairie dogs
from their subterranean retreats. Their cradle is a
flat board, padded, on which the infant is fastened;
on the upper part is a little hood to protect the head,
and it is carried by the mother on her back, suspended
by a strap.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Their saddles are simply two rolls of straw
covered with deer or antelope skin, which are connected
by a strap; a piece of raw hide serves for girths and
stirrups. In later years the Mexican saddle, or one
approaching it in shape, has been adopted, and the
Navajos have succeeded in making a pretty fair imitation
of it, of hard ash. Their bridles, which consist of a
rein attached to the lower jaw, are very severe on the
animal.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Although not essentially a fish-eating people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
the Mojaves and Axuas display considerable ingenuity
in the manufacture of fishing-nets, which are noted for
their strength and beauty. Plaited grass, or the fibry
bark of the willow, are the materials of which they are
made.<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Fire is obtained in the old primitive fashion of
rubbing together two pieces of wood, one soft and the
other hard. The hard piece is pointed and is twirled
on the softer piece, with a steady downward pressure
until sparks appear.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NAVAJO BLANKETS.</p>

<p>The Navajos excel all other nations of this family in
the manufacture of blankets.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> The art with them is
perhaps of Mexican origin, and they keep for this industry
large flocks of sheep.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Some say in making
blankets cotton is mixed with the wool, but I find no
notice of their cultivating cotton. Their looms are of
the most primitive kind. Two beams, one suspended
and the other fastened to the ground, serve to stretch the
warp perpendicularly, and two slats, inserted between
the double warp, cross and recross it and also open a
passage for the shuttle, which is simply a short stick
with some thread wound around it. The operator sits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
on the ground, and the blanket, as the weaving progresses,
is wound round the lower beam.<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> The wool,
after being carded, is spun with a spindle resembling a
boy's top, the stem being about sixteen inches long and
the lower point made to revolve in an earthen bowl by
being twirled rapidly between the forefinger and thumb.
The thread after being twisted is wound on the spindle,
and though not very even, it answers the purpose very
well.<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The patterns are mostly regular geometrical
figures, among which diamonds and parallels predominate.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
Black and red are the principal variations in
color, but blue and yellow are at times seen. Their
colors they obtain mostly by dyeing with vegetable substances,
but in later years they obtain also colored manufactured
materials from the whites, which they again
unravel, employing the colored threads obtained in this
manner in their own manufactures.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> They also weave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
a coarse woolen cloth, of which they at times make shirts
and leggins.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> Besides pottery of burnt clay, wickerwork
baskets, and saddles and bridles, no general industry
obtains in this family.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> Featherwork, such as
sewing various patterns on skins with feathers, and
other ornamental needlework, are also practiced by the
Navajos.<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>Of the Comanches, the Abbé Domenech relates that
they extracted silver from some mines near San Saba,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
from which they manufactured ornaments for themselves
and their saddles and bridles.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PROPERTY.</p>

<p>They have no boats, but use rafts of wood, or bundles
of rushes fastened tightly together with osier or willow
twigs, and propelled sometimes with poles; but more
frequently they place upon the craft their property and
wives, and, swimming alongside of it, with the greatest
ease push it before them.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> For their maintenance,
especially in latter days, they are indebted in a great
measure to their horses, and accordingly they consider
them as their most valuable property. The Navajos
are larger stock owners than any of the other nations,
possessing numerous flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle
as well as horses and mules. These, with their blankets,
their dressed skins, and peaches which they cultivate,
constitute their chief wealth.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Certain bands of the
Apache nation exchange with the agriculturists pottery
and skins for grain.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Among the Navajos, husband and
wife hold their property separate, and at their death it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
becomes the inheritance of the nephew or niece. This
law of entail is often eluded by the parents, who before
death give their goods to their children.<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> Their exchanges
are governed by caprice rather than by established
values. Sometimes they will give a valuable
blanket for a trifling ornament. The Mojaves have a
species of currency which they call <i>pook</i>, consisting of
strings of shell beads, whose value is determined by the
length.<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> At the time of Coronado's expedition, in 1540,
the Comanches possessed great numbers of dogs, which
they employed in transporting their buffalo-skin tents
and scanty household utensils.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> When a buffalo is
killed, the successful hunter claims only the hide; the
others are at liberty to help themselves to the meat according
to their necessities.<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> In their trading transactions
they display much shrewdness, and yet are free
from the tricks usually resorted to by other nations.<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ARTS AND CALENDAR.</p>

<p>Their knowledge of decorative art is limited; paintings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
and sculptures of men and animals, rudely executed
on rocks or walls of caverns are occasionally met
with; whether intended as hieroglyphical representations,
or sketched during the idle moments of some budding
genius, it is difficult to determine, owing to the fact
that the statements of the various authors who have investigated
the subject are conflicting.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The Comanches
display a certain taste in painting their buffalo-robes,
shields, and tents. The system of enumeration of the
Apaches exhibits a regularity and diffusiveness seldom
met with amongst wild tribes, and their language contains
all the terms for counting up to ten thousand.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> In
this respect the Comanches are very deficient; what little
knowledge of arithmetic they have is decimal, and when
counting, the aid of their fingers or presence of some
actual object is necessary, being, as they are, in total ignorance
of the simplest arithmetical calculation. The
rising sun proclaims to them a new day; beyond this
they have no computation or division of time. They
know nothing of the motions of the earth or heavenly
bodies, though they recognise the fixedness of the polar
star.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>Their social organization, like all their manners and
customs, is governed by their wild and migratory life.
Government they have none. Born and bred with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
idea of perfect personal freedom, all restraint is unendurable.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
The nominal authority vested in the war
chief, is obtained by election, and is subordinate to the
council of warriors.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> Every father holds undisputed
sway over his children until the age of puberty. His
power, importance, and influence at the council-fire is
determined by the amount of his slaves and other property.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Those specially distinguished by their cunning
and prowess in war, or success in the chase, are chosen
as chiefs.</p>

<p class="sidenote">COMANCHE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>A chief may at any time be deposed.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Sometimes
it happens that one family retains the chieftaincy in a
tribe during several generations, because of the bravery
or wealth of the sons.<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> In time of peace but little authority
is vested in the chief; but on the war path, to
ensure success, his commands are implicitly obeyed. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
also frequently happens that chiefs are chosen to lead
some particular war or marauding expedition, their authority
expiring immediately upon their return home.<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>Among the Comanches public councils are held at
regular intervals during the year, when matters pertaining
to the common weal are discussed, laws made, thefts,
seditions, murders, and other crimes punished, and the
quarrels of warrior-chiefs settled. Smaller councils are
also held, in which, as well as in the larger ones, all are
free to express their opinion.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Questions laid before
them are taken under consideration, a long time frequently
elapsing before a decision is made. Great care
is taken that the decrees of the meeting shall be in accordance
with the opinion and wishes of the majority.
Laws are promulgated by a public crier, who ranks next
to the chief in dignity.<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Ancestral customs and traditions govern the decisions
of the councils; brute force, or right of the strongest,
with the law of talion in its widest acceptance, direct
the mutual relations of tribes and individuals.<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Murder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
adultery, theft, and sedition are punished with death or
public exposure, or settled by private agreement or the
interposition of elderly warriors. The doctor failing to
cure his patient must be punished by death. The court
of justice is the council of the tribe, presided over by
the chiefs, the latter with the assistance of sub-chiefs,
rigidly executing judgment upon the culprits.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> All
crimes may be pardoned but murder, which must pay
blood for blood if the avenger overtake his victim.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>All the natives of this family hold captives as slaves;<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
some treat them kindly, employing the men as herders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
and marrying the women; others half-starve and scourge
them, and inflict on them the most painful labors.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
Nothing short of crucifixion, roasting by a slow fire, or
some other most excruciating form of death, can atone the
crime of attempted escape from bondage. They not only
steal children from other tribes and sell them, but carry
on a most unnatural traffic in their own offspring.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF WOMEN.</p>

<p>Womankind as usual is not respected. The female
child receives little care from its mother, being only of
collateral advantage to the tribe. Later she becomes
the beast of burden and slave of her husband. Some
celebrate the entry into womanhood with feasting and
dancing.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> Courtship is simple and brief; the wooer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
pays for his bride and takes her home.<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Every man
may have all the wives he can buy. There is generally
a favorite, or chief wife, who exercises authority over
<span class="sidenote">MARRIAGE AND CHILD-BIRTH.</span>
the others. As polygamy causes a greater division
of labor, the women do not object to it.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Sometimes
a feast of horse-flesh celebrates a marriage.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> All
the labor of preparing food, tanning skins, cultivating
fields, making clothes, and building houses, falls to the
women, the men considering it beneath their dignity to
do anything but hunt and fight. The women feed and
saddle the horses of their lords; oftentimes they are
cruelly beaten, mutilated, and even put to death.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
marriage yoke sits lightly; the husband may repudiate
his wife at will and take back the property given for her;
the wife may abandon her husband, but by the latter
act she covers him with such disgrace that it may only
be wiped out by killing somebody<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>&mdash;anybody whom
he may chance to meet. In the event of a separation
the children follow the mother. They are not a prolific
race; indeed, it is but seldom that a woman has more
than three or four children. As usual parturition is
easy; but owing to unavoidable exposure many of their
infants soon die. The naming of the child is attended
with superstitious rites, and on reaching the age of
puberty they never fail to change its name.<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Immediately
after the birth of the child, it is fastened to a
small board, by bandages, and so carried for several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
months on the back of the mother. Later the child
rides on the mother's hip, or is carried on her back in a
basket or blanket, which in travelling on horseback is
fastened to the pommel of the saddle. Boys are early
taught the use of weapons, and early learn their superiority
over girls, being seldom or never punished.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>It is a singular fact that of all these people the thievish
meat-eating Apache is almost the only one who
makes any pretentions to female chastity. All authorities
agree that the Apache women both before and after
marriage are remarkably pure.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>Yuma husbands for gain surrender not only their
slaves, but their wives. Hospitality carries with it the
obligation of providing for the guest a temporary wife.
The usual punishment for infidelity is the mutilation of
the nose or ears, which disfigurement prevents the offender
from marrying, and commonly sends her forth as
a public harlot in the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> The seducer can appease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
the anger of an injured husband by presents, although
before the law he forfeits his life. Even sodomy and
incestuous intercourse occur among them. Old age is
dishonorable.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">AMUSEMENTS.<br />
SMOKING AND DANCING.</p>

<p>They are immoderately fond of smoking, drinking,
feasting, and amusements which fill up the many hours
of idleness. Dancing and masquerading is the most
favorite pastime. They have feasts with dances to celebrate
victories, feasts given at marriage, and when girls
attain the age of puberty; a ceremonial is observed at
the burial of noted warriors, and on other various occasions
of private family life, in which both men and
women take part. The dance is performed by a single
actor or by a number of persons of both sexes to the
accompaniment of instruments or their own voices.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
All festivities are incomplete without impromptu songs,
the music being anything but agreeable, and the accompaniment
corn-stalk or cane flutes, wooden drums, or
calabashes filled with stone and shaken to a constantly
varying time.<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> They also spend much time in gambling,
often staking their whole property on a throw, including
everything upon their backs. One of these
games is played with a bullet, which is passed rapidly
from one hand to the other, during which they sing, assisting
the music with the motion of their arms. The
game consists in guessing in which hand the bullet is
held. Another Comanche game is played with twelve
sticks, each about six inches in length. These are
dropped on the ground and those falling across each
other are counted for game, one hundred being the limit.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
Horse-racing is likewise a passion with them;<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>
as are also all other athletic sports.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> When smoking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
the Comanches direct the first two puffs, with much ceremony
and muttering, to the sun, and the third puff
with a like demonstration is blown toward the earth.
When short of tobacco, they make use of the dried
leaves of the sumach, of willow-bark, or other plants.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>The Comanches are remarkable for their temperance,
or rather abhorrence for intoxicating drink; all the other
nations of this family abandon themselves to this subtle
demoralization, and are rapidly sinking under it. They
make their own spirits out of corn and out of agave
americana, the pulque and mescal, both very strong and
intoxicating liquors.<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>Of all North American Indians the Comanches and
Cheyennes are said to be the most skillful riders, and
it would be difficult to find their superiors in any part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
of the world. Young children, almost infants, are tied
by their mothers to half-wild, bare-backed mustangs,
which place thenceforth becomes their home. They
supply themselves with fresh horses from wild droves
wandering over the prairies, or from Mexican rancherías.
A favorite horse is loved and cherished above all things
on earth, not excepting wives or children. The women
are scarcely behind the men in this accomplishment.
They sit astride, guide the horses with the knee like the
men, and catch and break wild colts. In fighting, the
Comanches throw the body on one side of the horse, hang
on by the heel and shoot with great precision and rapidity.
It is beneath the dignity of these horsemen to travel on
foot, and in their sometimes long and rapid marches,
they defy pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Before horses were known they
used to transport their household effects on the backs of
dogs, which custom even now prevails among some nations.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">COMANCHE CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>The Comanche observes laws of hospitality as strictly
as the Arab, and he exacts the observance of his rules
of etiquette from strangers. When a visitor enters his
dwelling, the master of the house points to him a seat,
and how to reach it, and the host is greatly offended if
his directions are not strictly followed. Meeting on the
prairie, friends as well as enemies, if we may believe
Colonel Marcy, put their horses at full speed. "When
a party is discovered approaching thus, and are near
enough to distinguish signals, all that is necessary to
ascertain their disposition is to raise the right hand
with the palm in front, and gradually push it forward
and back several times. They all understand this to be
a command to halt, and if they are not hostile, it will
at once be obeyed. After they have stopped, the right
hand is raised again as before, and slowly moved to the
right and left, which signifies, I do not know you. Who
are you? They will then answer the inquiry by giving
their signal." Then they inflict on strangers the hugging
and face-rubbing remarked among the Eskimos,
demonstrating thereby the magnitude of their joy at
meeting.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> The various tribes of the Yuma and Mojave
nations hold communication with one another by
means of couriers or runners, who quickly disseminate
important news, and call together the various bands for
consultation, hunting, and war. Besides this, there is
used everywhere on the prairies, a system of telegraphy,
which perhaps is only excelled by the wires themselves.
Smoke during the day, and fires at night, perched on
mountain-tops, flash intelligence quickly and surely across
the plains, giving the call for assistance or the order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
disperse when pursued. The advanced posts also inform
the main body of the approach of strangers, and all this
is done with astonishing regularity, by either increasing
or diminishing the signal column, or by displaying it
only at certain intervals or by increasing the number.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
In cold weather many of the nations in the neighborhood
of the Colorado, carry firebrands in their hands,
as they assert for the purpose of warming themselves,
which custom led the early visitors to name the Colorado
the Rio del Tizon.<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DISEASES AND MEDICINE.</p>

<p>The Comanches stand in great dread of evil spirits,
which they attempt to conciliate by fasting and abstinence.
When their demons withhold rain or sunshine,
according as they desire, they whip a slave, and if their
gods prove obdurate, their victim is almost flayed alive.
The Navajos venerate the bear, and as before stated, never
kill him nor touch any of his flesh.<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Although early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
writers speak of cannibalism among these people, there
is no evidence that they do or ever did eat human
flesh.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> In their intercourse they are dignified and reserved,
and never interrupt a person speaking. Unless
compelled by necessity, they never speak any language
but their own, it being barbarous in their eyes to make
use of foreign tongues.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BURIAL OF THE DEAD.</p>

<p>Although endowed generally with robust and healthy
constitutions, bilious and malarial fever, pneumonia,
rheumatism, dysentery, ophthalmia, measles, small-pox,
and various syphilitic diseases are sometimes met among
them; the latter occurring most frequently among the
Navajos, Mojaves, Yumas, and Comanches. Whole
bands are sometimes affected with the last-mentioned
disease, and its effects are often visible in their young.
A cutaneous ailment, called <i>pintos</i>, also makes its appearance
at times.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> For these ailments they have different
remedies, consisting of leaves, herbs, and roots, of
which decoctions or poultices are made; scarification and
the hunger cure are resorted to as well. Among the Mojaves
the universal remedy is the sweat-house, employed
by them and the other nations not only as a remedy for
diseases, but for pleasure. There is no essential difference
between their sweat-houses and those of northern
nations&mdash;an air-tight hut near a stream, heated stones,
upon which water is thrown to generate steam, and a
plunge into the water afterward. As a cure for the bite
of a rattlesnake they employ an herb called <i>euphorbia</i>.
Broken or wounded limbs are encased in wooden splints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
until healed. But frequently they abandon their sick and
maimed, or treat them with great harshness.<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Priests
or medicine-men possess almost exclusively the secrets
of the art of healing. When herbs fail they resort to
incantations, songs, and wailings. They are firm believers
in witchcraft, and wear as amulets and charms,
feathers, stones, antelope-toes, crane's bills, bits of charred
wood and the like. Their prophets claim the power of
foretelling future events, and are frequently consulted
therefor.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Most of the nations in the vicinity of the
Colorado, burn their dead as soon as possible after death,
on which occasion the worldly effects of the deceased
are likewise spiritualized; utensils, property, sometimes
wives, are sent with their master to the spirit land.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
Those that do not burn the dead, bury them in caves or
in shallow graves, with the robes, blankets, weapons,
utensils, and ornaments of the deceased. The Comanches
frequently build a heap of stones over the grave of
a warrior, near which they erect a pole from which a
pair of moccasins is suspended.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> After burying the
corpse, they have some mourning ceremonies, such as
dances and songs around a fire, and go into mourning
for a month. As a sign of grief they cut off the manes
and tails of their horses, and also crop their own hair
and lacerate their bodies in various ways; the women
giving vent to their affliction by long continued
howlings. But this applies only to warriors; children,
and old men, are not worth so ostentatious a funeral.<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
The name of a deceased person is rarely mentioned, and
the Apaches are shy of admitting strangers to a celebration
of funeral ceremonies, which mostly take place at
night. In general they are averse to speaking upon the
subject of death at all. The Navajos, says Mr Davis,
"have a superstitious dread of approaching a dead body,
and will never go near one when they can avoid it."<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NEW MEXICAN CHARACTER.</p>

<p>In the character of the several nations of this division
there is a marked contrast. The Apaches as I have
said, though naturally lazy like all savages, are in their
industries extremely active,&mdash;their industries being theft
and murder, to which they are trained by their mothers,
and in which they display consummate cunning, treachery,
and cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The Navajos and Mojaves display
a more docile nature; their industries, although therein
they do not claim to eschew all trickery, being of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
more peaceful, substantial character, such as stock-raising,
agriculture, and manufactures. Professional thieving
is not countenanced. Though treacherous, they are
not naturally cruel; and though deaf to the call of gratitude,
they are hospitable and socially inclined. They
are ever ready to redeem their pledged word, and never
shrink from the faithful performance of a contract.
They are brave and intelligent, and possess much natural
common sense.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> The Tamajabs have no inclination
to share in marauding excursions. Though not
wanting in courage, they possess a mild disposition, and
are kind to strangers.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> The Comanches are dignified
in their deportment, vain in respect to their personal
appearance, ambitious of martial fame, unrelenting in
their feuds, always exacting blood for blood, yet not
sanguinary. They are true to their allies, prizing highly
their freedom, hospitable to strangers, sober yet gay,
maintaining a grave stoicism in presence of strangers,
and a Spartan indifference under severe suffering or misfortune.
Formal, discreet, and Arab-like, they are
always faithful to the guest who throws himself upon
their hospitality. To the valiant and brave is awarded
the highest place in their esteem. They are extremely
clannish in their social relations. Quarrels among relatives
and friends are unheard of among them.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>

<p class="sidenote">THE PUEBLOS.</p>

<p class="p2">The non-nomadic semi-civilized town and agricultural
peoples of New Mexico and Arizona, the second division
of this group, I call the <span class="smcap">Pueblos</span>, or Towns-people, from
<i>pueblo</i>, town, population, people, a name given by the
Spaniards to such inhabitants of this region as were
found, when first discovered, permanently located in
comparatively well-built towns. Strictly speaking, the
term Pueblos applies only to the villagers settled along
the banks of the Rio Grande del Norte and its tributaries,
between latitudes 34° 45´ and 36° 30´, and although
the name is employed as a general appellation for
this division, it will be used, for the most part, only in
its narrower and popular sense. In this division, besides
the before-mentioned <i>Pueblos</i> proper, are embraced
the <i>Moquis</i>, or villagers of eastern Arizona, and the
non-nomadic agricultural nations of the lower Gila
River,&mdash;the <i>Pimas</i>, <i>Maricopas</i>, <i>Pápagos</i>, and cognate
tribes. The country of the Towns-people, if we may
credit Lieutenant Simpson, is one of "almost universal
barrenness," yet interspersed with fertile spots; that of
the agricultural nations, though dry, is more generally
productive. The fame of this so-called civilization
reached Mexico at an early day; first through Alvar
Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and his companions, who belonged
to the expedition under the unfortunate Pámphilo
de Narvaez, traversing the continent from Florida to the
shore of the gulf of California; they brought in exaggerated
rumors of great cities to the north, which prompted
the expeditions of Marco de Niza in 1539, of Coronado
in 1540, and of Espejo in 1586. These adventurers
visited the north in quest of the fabulous kingdoms of
Quivira, Tontonteac, Marata and others, in which great
riches were said to exist. The name of Quivira was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
afterwards applied by them to one or more of the pueblo
cities. The name Cíbola, from <i>cíbolo</i>, Mexican bull, <i>bos
bison</i>, or wild ox of New Mexico, where the Spaniards
first encountered buffalo, was given to seven of the towns
which were afterwards known as the seven cities of Cíbola.
But most of the villages known at the present
day were mentioned in the reports of the early expeditions
by their present names. The statements in regard
to the number of their villages differed from the first.
Castañeda speaks of seven cities.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> The following list,
according to Lieutenant Whipple's statement, appears to
be the most complete. Commencing north, and following
the southward course of the Rio Grande del Norte;
Shipap, Acoti, Taos, Picuris, San Juan, Pojuaque, Santa
Clara, San Ildefonso, Nambe, Tesuque, Cochite, Pecos,
Santo Domingo, Cuyamanque, Silla, Jemez, San Felipe,
Galisteo, Santa Ana, Zandia, Laguna, Acoma, Zuñi,
Isleta, and Chilili.<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> The Moquis who speak a distinct
language, and who have many customs peculiar to themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
inhabit seven villages, named Oraibe, Shumuthpa,
Mushaiina, Ahlela, Gualpi, Siwinna, and Tegua.<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>By the Spanish conquest of New Mexico the natives
were probably disturbed less than was usually the case
with the vanquished race; the Pueblos being well-domiciled
and well-behaved, and having little to be stolen,
the invaders adopted the wise policy of permitting them
to work in peace, and to retain the customs and traditions
of their forefathers as they do, many of them, to
this day. Attempts have been made to prove a relationship
with the civilized Aztecs of Mexico, but thus far
without success. No affinities in language appear to
exist; that of the Moquis, indeed, contains a few faint
traces of and assimilations to Aztec words, as I shall
show in the third volume of this work, but they are not
strong enough to support any theory of common origin
or relationship.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PIMAS AND PÁPAGOS.</p>

<p>The Pimas inhabit the banks of the Gila River about
two hundred miles above its confluence with the Colorado.
Their territory extends from about the bend of
the Gila up the river to a place called Maricopa Coppermine;
northward their boundary is the Salt River, and
south the Picacho. They are generally divided, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
known as the upper and lower Pimas, which branches
show but slight dialectic differences. When first seen
their territory extended further southward into Sonora.
The Pápagos, their neighbors, are closely allied to them
by language. In nowise related to them, but very similar
in their manners and customs, are the Maricopas,
who reside in their immediate vicinity, and who claim
to have migrated to that place some centuries ago, from
a more westerly territory.</p>

<p>All these people, although not dwelling in houses
built, like those of the Pueblos, of solid materials, have
settled villages in which they reside at all times, and
are entirely distinct from the roving and nomadic tribes
described in the Apache family. When first found by
the Spaniards, they cultivated the soil, and knew how
to weave cotton and other fabrics; in fact it was easily
observable that they had made a step toward civilization.
I therefore describe them together with the
Pueblos. The region occupied by them, although containing
some good soil, is scantily provided with water,
and to enable them to raise crops, they are obliged to
irrigate, conducting the water of the Gila to their fields
in small canals. The water obtained by digging wells
is frequently brackish, and in many places they are
forced to carry all the water needed for household purposes
quite a long distance. The climate is claimed
to be one of the hottest on the American continent.</p>

<p>The Pueblos, and Moqui villagers, are a race of small
people, the men averaging about five feet in height, with
small hands and feet, well-cut features, bright eyes, and
a generally pleasing expression of countenance.<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> Their
hair is dark, soft, and of fine texture, and their skin a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
clear shade of brown.<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The woman seldom exceed
four feet in height, with figure rotund, but a graceful
carriage, and face full, with pretty, intelligent features
and good teeth.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Albinos are at times seen amongst
them, who are described as having very fair complexions,
light hair, and blue or pink eyes.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS OF THE PUEBLOS.</p>

<p>The Pimas and their neighbors are men of fine physique,
tall and bony, many of them exceeding six feet
in height, broad-chested, erect, and muscular, but frequently
light-limbed with small hands, though the feet
of both sexes are large. They have large features, expressive
of frankness and good nature, with prominent
cheek-bones and aquiline nose, those of the women being
somewhat retroussés.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> The females are symmetrically
formed, with beautifully tapered limbs, full busts, pleasing
features, embellished with white and evenly set
teeth.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Their coarse hair grows to a great length
and thickness, and their dark complexion becomes yet
darker toward the south.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> The ordinary dress of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
Pueblos is the breech-cloth and blanket; some add a
blouse of cotton or deer-skin, a waist-belt, and buckskin
leggins and moccasins. The women wear a long, cotton,
sleeveless tunic, confined round the waist by a
colored girdle, a species of cape bordered in different
colors, fastened round the neck at the two corners, and
reaching down to the waist, while over the head a shawl
is thrown. The feet are protected by neat moccasins of
deer-skin or woolen stuff, surmounted by leggins of the
same material. They have a habit of padding the leggins,
which makes them appear short-legged with small
feet.<a name="FNanchor_801a" id="FNanchor_801a" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> The men bind a handkerchief or colored band
round the head. Young women dress the hair in a
peculiarly neat and becoming style. Parting it at the
back, they roll it round hoops, when it is fastened in
two high bunches, one on each side of the head, placing
sometimes a single feather in the center; married women
gather it into two tight knots at the side or one at the
back of the head; the men cut it in front of the ears,
and in a line with the eye-brows, while at the back it is
plaited or gathered into a single bunch, and tied with a
band.<a name="FNanchor_801b" id="FNanchor_801b" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> On gala occasions they paint and adorn themselves
in many grotesque styles; arms, legs, and exposed
portions of the body are covered with stripes or rings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
and conical-shaped head-dresses; feathers, sheep-skin
wigs, and masks, are likewise employed.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> The habiliments
of the Pimas are a cotton serape of their own
manufacture, a breech-cloth, with sandals of raw-hide
or deer-skin. Women wear the same kind of serape,
wound round the loins and pinned, or more frequently
tucked in at the waist, or fastened with a belt in which
different-colored wools are woven; some wear a short
petticoat of deer-skin or bark.<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> They wear no head-dress.
Like the Pueblos, the men cut the hair short
across the forehead, and either plait it in different coils
behind, which are ornamented with bits of bone, shells,
or red cloth, or mix it with clay, or gather it into a turban
shape on top of the head, leaving a few ornamented
and braided locks to hang down over the ears.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Each
paints in a manner to suit the fancy; black, red, and
yellow are the colors most in vogue, black being alone
used for war paint. Some tattoo their newly born children
round the eyelids, and girls, on arriving at the
age of maturity, tattoo from the corners of the mouth
to the chin. Some tribes oblige their women to cut the
hair, others permit it to grow.<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> For ornament, shell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
and bead necklaces are used; also ear-rings of a blue
stone found in the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> The dwellings of the
<span class="sidenote">PIMA AND MARICOPA DWELLINGS.</span>
agricultural Pimas, Maricopas, and Pápagos consist of
dome-shaped huts, either round or oval at the base.
There are usually thirty or more to a village, and they
are grouped with some regard to regularity. Strong
forked stakes are firmly fixed in the ground at regular
distances from each other, the number varying according
to the size of the hut, cross-poles are laid from one
to the other, around these are placed cotton-wood poles,
which are bent over and fastened to the transverse sticks,
the structure is then wattled with willows, reeds, or
coarse straw, and the whole covered with a coat of mud.
The only openings are an entrance door about three feet
high, and a small aperture in the center of the roof that
serves for ventilation. Their height is from five to seven
feet, and the diameter from twenty to fifty. Outside
stands a shed, open at all sides with a roof of branches
or corn-stalks, under which they prepare their food.
Their houses are occupied mainly during the rainy season;
in summer they build light sheds of twigs in their
corn-fields, which not only are more airy, but are also
more convenient in watching their growing crops. Besides
the dwelling-place, each family has a granary,
similar in shape and of like materials but of stronger
construction; by frequent plastering with mud they are
made impervious to rain.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> The towns of the Pueblos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
are essentially unique, and are the dominant feature of
these aboriginals. Some of them are situated in valleys,
others on mesas; sometimes they are planted on elevations
almost inaccessible, reached only by artificial grades
or by steps cut in the solid rock. Some of the towns are
of an elliptical shape, while others are square, a town
being frequently but a block of buildings. Thus a
Pueblo consists of one or more squares, each enclosed by
three or four buildings of from three to four hundred
feet in length, and about one hundred and fifty feet in
width at the base, and from two to seven stories of from
eight to nine feet each in height. The buildings forming
the square do not meet, but in some cases are connected
by bridges or covered gangways, and in some
instances the houses project over the streets below,
which being narrow, are thus given an underground
appearance. The stories are built in a series of gradations
or retreating surfaces, decreasing in size as they
rise, thus forming a succession of terraces.</p>

<p>In some of the towns these terraces are on both
sides of the building; in others they face only toward
the outside; while again in others they are on the inside.
In front of the terraces is a parapet, which serves
as a shelter for the inhabitants when forced to defend
themselves against an attack from the outside. These
terraces are about six feet wide, and extend round the
three or four sides of the square, forming a walk for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
the occupants of the story resting upon it, and a roof for
the story beneath; so with the stories above. As there
is no inner communication with one another, the only
means of mounting to them is by ladders which stand
at convenient distances along the several rows of terraces,
and they may be drawn up at pleasure, thus cutting
off all unwelcome intrusion. The outside walls of
one or more of the lower stories are entirely solid, having
no openings of any kind, with the exception of, in
some towns, a few loopholes. All the doors and windows
are on the inside opening on the court. The several
stories of these huge structures are divided into
multitudinous compartments of greater or lesser size,
which are apportioned to the several families of the
tribe. Access is had to the different stories by means
of the ladders, which at night and in times of danger
are drawn up after the person entering. To enter the
rooms on the ground floor from the outside, one must
mount the ladder to the first balcony or terrace, then
descend through a trap door in the floor by another ladder
on the inside. The roofs or ceilings, which are nearly
flat, are formed of transverse beams which slope slightly
outward, the ends resting on the side walls; on these, to
make the floor and terrace of the story above, is laid
brush wood, then a layer of bark or thin slabs, and over
all a thick covering of mud sufficient to render them
water-tight. The windows in the upper stories are made
of flakes of selenite instead of glass. The rooms are
large, the substantial partitions are made of wood, and
neatly whitewashed. The apartments on the ground
floor are gloomy, and generally used as store-rooms;
those above are sometimes furnished with a small fireplace,
the chimney leading out some feet above the terrace.
<span class="sidenote">PUEBLO HOUSES.</span>
Houses are common property, and both men and
women assist in building them; the men erect the wooden
frames, and the women make the mortar and build the
walls. In place of lime for mortar, they mix ashes with
earth and charcoal. They make adobes or sun-dried
bricks by mixing ashes and earth with water, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
then moulded into large blocks and dried in the sun.
Some of the towns are built with stones laid in mud.
Captain Simpson describes several ruined cities, which
he visited, which show that the inhabitants formerly had
a knowledge of architecture and design superior to any
that the Pueblos of the present day possess. Yet their
buildings are even now well constructed, for although
several stories in height, the walls are seldom more than
three or four feet in thickness. The apartments are
well arranged and neatly kept; one room is used for
cooking, another for grinding corn and preserving winter
supplies of food, others for sleeping-rooms. On the balconies,
round the doors opening upon them, the villagers
congregate to gossip and smoke, while the streets
below, when the ladders are drawn up, present a gloomy
and forsaken appearance. Sometimes villages are built in
the form of an open square with buildings on three sides,
and again two or more large terraced structures capable
of accommodating one or two thousand people are built
contiguous to each other, or on opposite banks of a stream.
In some instances the outer wall presents one unbroken
line, without entrance or anything to indicate the busy
life within; another form is to join the straight walls,
which encompass three sides of a square, by a fourth
circular wall; in all of which the chief object is defense.
The Pueblos take great pride in their picturesque and,
to them, magnificent structures, affirming that as fortresses
they have ever proved impregnable. To wall out
black barbarism was what the Pueblos wanted, and to
be let alone; under these conditions time was giving
them civilization.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PUEBLO ESTUFAS.</p>

<p>The sweat-house, or as the Spaniards call it, the <i>estufa</i>,
assumes with the Pueblos the grandest proportions.
Every village has from one to six of these singular structures.
A large, semi-subterranean room, it is at once
bath-house, town-house, council-chamber, club-room,
and church. It consists of a large excavation, the roof
being about on a level with the ground, sometimes a little
above it, and is supported by heavy timbers or pillars of
masonry. Around the sides are benches, and in the
center of the floor a square stone box for fire, wherein
aromatic plants are kept constantly burning. Entrance
is made by means of a ladder, through a hole in the top
placed directly over the fire-place so that it also serves
as a ventilator and affords a free passage to the smoke.
Usually they are circular in form and of both large and
small dimensions; they are placed either within the great
building or underground in the court without. In some
of the ruins they are found built in the center of what
was once a pyramidal pile, and four stories in height.
At Jemez the estufa is of one story, twenty-five feet
wide by thirty feet high. The ruins of Chettro Kettle
contain six estufas, each two or three stories in height.
At Bonito are estufas one hundred and seventy-five feet
in circumference, built in alternate layers of thick and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
thin stone slabs. In these subterranean temples the
old men met in secret council, or assembled in worship
of their gods. Here are held dances and festivities,
social intercourse, and mourning ceremonies. Certain
of the Pueblos have a custom similar to that practiced
by some of the northern tribes, the men sleeping in the
sweat-house with their feet to the fire, and permitting
women to enter only to bring them food. The estufas
of Tiguex were situated in the heart of the village, built
underground, both round and square, and paved with
large polished stones.<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HOW FOOD IS OBTAINED.</p>

<p>From the earliest information we have of these nations
they are known to have been tillers of the soil;
and though the implements used and their methods of
cultivation were both simple and primitive, cotton, corn,
wheat, beans, with many varieties of fruits, which constituted
their principal food, were raised in abundance.
The Pueblos breed poultry to a considerable extent; fish
are eaten whenever obtainable, as also a few wild animals,
such as deer, hares, and rabbits, though they are
indifferent hunters.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> The Pápagos, whose country does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
not present such favorable conditions for agriculture are
forced to rely for a subsistence more upon wild fruits
and animals than the nations north of them. They
collect large quantities of the fruit of the pitahaya (<i>cereus
giganteus</i>), and in seasons of scarcity resort to
whatever is life-sustaining, not disdaining even snakes,
lizards, and toads.<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> Most of these people irrigate their
lands by means of conduits or ditches, leading either
from the river or from tanks in which rain-water is collected
and stored for the purpose. These ditches are
kept in repair by the community, but farming operations
are carried on by each family for its own separate benefit,
which is a noticeable advance from the usual savage
communism.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Fishing nets are made of twisted thread
or of small sticks joined together at the ends. When
the rivers are low, fish are caught in baskets or shot with
arrows to which a string is attached.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> The corn which
is stored for winter use, is first par-boiled in the shuck,
and then suspended from strings to dry; peaches are
dried in large quantities, and melons are preserved by
peeling and removing the seeds, when they are placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
in the sun, and afterward hung up in trees. Meal is
ground on the metate and used for making porridge, tortillas,
and a very thin cake called <i>guayave</i>, which latter
forms a staple article of food amongst the Pueblos. The
process of making the guayave, as seen by Lieutenant
Simpson at Santo Domingo on the Rio Grande, is thus
described in his journal. "At the house of the governor
I noticed a woman, probably his wife, going through
the process of baking a very thin species of corn cake,
called, according to Gregg, guayave. She was hovering
over a fire, upon which lay a flat stone. Near her was
a bowl of thin corn paste, into which she thrust her
fingers; allowing then the paste to drip sparingly upon
the stone, with two or three wipes from the palm of her
hand she would spread it entirely and uniformly over
the stone; this was no sooner done than she peeled it
off as fit for use; and the process was again and again
repeated, until a sufficient quantity was obtained.
When folded and rolled together, it does not look unlike
(particularly that made from the blue corn) a hornet's
nest&mdash;a name by which it is sometimes called." The
Pimas do all their cooking out of doors, under a shed
erected for the purpose. They collect the pulp from the
fruit of the pitahaya, and boiling it in water, make a
thick syrup, which they store away for future use. They
also dry the fruit in the sun like figs.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>The Pueblos and Moquis are remarkable for their
personal cleanliness and the neatness of their dwellings.<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PUEBLO WEAPONS.</p>

<p>Their weapons are bows and arrows, spears, and clubs.
The Pueblos use a crooked stick, which they throw somewhat
in the manner of the boomerang; they are exceedingly
skillful in the use of the sling, with a stone from
which they are said to be able to hit with certainty a
small mark or kill a deer at the distance of a hundred
yards. For defense, they use a buckler or shield made
of raw hide. Their arrows are carried in skin quivers
or stuck in the belt round the waist.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Bows are made
of willow, and are about six feet in length, strung with
twisted deer-sinews; arrows are made of reeds, into
which a piece of hard wood is fitted.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> The Pimas
wing their war arrows with three feathers and point
them with flint, while for hunting purposes they have
only two feathers and wooden points.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> It has been
stated that they poison them, but there does not appear
to be good foundation for this assertion.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Clubs, which
are used in hand-to-hand combats, are made of a hard,
heavy wood, measuring from twenty to twenty-four
inches in length. In former days they were sharpened
by inserting flint or obsidian along the edge.<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR CEREMONIES.</p>

<p>The Pimas wage unceasing war against the Apaches,
and the Pueblos are ever at enmity with their neighbors,
the Navajos. The Pueblos are securely protected
by the position and construction of their dwellings, from
the top of which they are able to watch the appearance
and movements of enemies, and should any be daring
enough to approach their walls, they are greeted by a
shower of stones and darts. As an additional protection
to their towns, they dig pitfalls on the trails leading
to them, at the bottom of which sharp-pointed stakes
are driven, the top of the hole being carefully covered.<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
Expeditions are sometimes organized against the Navajos
for the recovery of stolen property. On such occasions
the Towns-people equip themselves with the heads, horns,
and tails of wild animals, paint the body and plume the
head.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> Lieutenant Simpson mentions a curious custom
observed by them, just previous to going into action.
"They halted on the way to receive from their chiefs
some medicine from the medicine bags which each of
them carried about his person. This they rubbed upon
their heart, as they said, to make it big and brave."
The Pueblos fight on horseback in skirmishing order,
and keep up a running fight, throwing the body into various
attitudes, the better to avoid the enemies' missiles,
at the same time discharging their arrows with rapidity.<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
The Pimas, who fight usually on foot, when they decide
on going to war, select their best warriors, who are sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
to notify the surrounding villages, and a place of meeting
is named where a grand council is held. A fire
being lighted and a circle of warriors formed, the proceedings
are opened by war songs and speeches, their
prophet is consulted, and in accordance with his professional
advice, their plan of operations is arranged.<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
The attack is usually made about day-break, and conducted
with much pluck and vigor. They content themselves
with proximate success, and seldom pursue a
flying foe.<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> During the heat of battle they spare
neither sex nor age, but if prisoners are taken, the males
are crucified or otherwise cruelly put to death, and the
women and children sold as soon as possible.<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> The
successful war party on its return is met by the inhabitants
of the villages, scalps are fixed on a pole, trophies
displayed, and feasting and dancing indulged in for several
days and nights; if unsuccessful, mourning takes
the place of feasting, and the death-cries of the women
resound through the villages.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PUEBLO TRADE.</p>

<p>For farming implements they use plows, shovels, harrows,
hatchets, and sticks, all of wood.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> Baskets of
willow-twigs, so closely woven as to be water-tight, and
ornamented with figures; and round, baked, and glazed
earthen vessels, narrow at the top, and decorated with
paintings or enamel, are their household utensils.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
mashing hulled corn they used the metate, a Mexican
implement, made of two stones, one concave and the
other convex, hereafter more fully described. Among
their household utensils there must also be mentioned
hair sieves, hide ropes, water-gourds, painted fans, stone
pipes, and frame panniers connected with a netting to
carry loads on their backs.<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> In their manufacture of
blankets, of cotton and woolen cloths, and stockings,
the Pueblos excel their neighbors, the Navajos,
although employing essentially the same method, and
using similar looms and spinning instruments, as have
been described in the preceding pages. Although the
women perform most of this work, as well as tanning
leather, it is said that the men also are expert in knitting
woolen stockings. According to Mühlenpfordt
the Pimas and Maricopas make a basket-boat which they
call <i>cora</i>, woven so tight as to be water-proof without
the aid of pitch or other application.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> All these nations,
particularly the Pueblos, have great droves of horses,
mules, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats grazing on the
extensive plains, and about their houses poultry, turkeys,
and dogs. The flocks they either leave entirely unprotected,
or else the owner herds them himself, or from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
each village one is appointed by the war captain to do
so. The Pápagos carry on an extensive trade in salt,
taken from the great inland salt lakes. Besides corn,
they manufacture and sell a syrup extracted from the
pitahaya.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> The laws regulating inheritance of property
are not well defined. Among some there is nothing
to inherit, as all is destroyed when the person dies;
among others the females claim the right of inheritance;
at other times the remaining property is divided
among all the members of the tribe. In general they
care but little for gold, and all their trade, which at
times is considerable, is carried on by barter; a kind
of blue stone, often called turquoise, beads, skins, and
blankets, serving the purpose of currency.<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>The Pueblos display much taste in painting the walls
of their estufas, where are represented different plants,
birds, and animals symmetrically done, but without any
scenic effect. Hieroglyphic groupings, both sculptured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
and painted, are frequently seen in the ancient Pueblo
towns, depicting, perhaps, their historical events and
deeds. With colored earths their pottery is painted
in bright colors.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Many Spanish authors mention a
great many gold and silver vessels in use amongst them,
and speak of the knowledge they had in reducing and
working these metals; but no traces of such art are
found at present.<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">LAWS OF THE PUEBLOS.</p>

<p>Among the Pueblos an organized system of government
existed at the time of Coronado's expedition
through their country; Castañeda, speaking of the
province of Tiguex, says that the villages were governed
by a council of old men; and a somewhat similar system
obtains with these people at the present time. Each
village selects its own governor, frames its own laws,
and in all respects they act independently of each other.
The governor and his council are elected annually by
the people; all affairs of importance and matters relating
to the welfare of the community are discussed at the
estufa; questions in dispute are usually decided by a
vote of the majority. All messages and laws emanating
from the council-chamber are announced to the inhabitants
by town criers. The morals of young people are
carefully watched and guarded by a kind of secret
police, whose duty it is to report to the governor all
irregularities which may occur; and especial attention
is given that no improper intercourse shall be allowed
between the young men and women, in the event of
which the offending parties are brought before the governor
and council and, if guilty, ordered to marry,
or if they refuse they are restricted from holding intercourse
with each other, and if they persist they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
whipped. Among their laws deserves to be particularly
mentioned one, according to which no one can sell or
marry out of the town until he obtains permission from
the authorities.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> In the seven confederate pueblos of
the Moquis, the office of chief governor is hereditary; it
is not, however, necessarily given to the nearest heir, as
the people have the power to elect any member of the
dominant family. The governor is assisted by a council
of elders, and in other respects the Moqui government
is similar to that of the other towns.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> The Pimas and
Maricopas have no organized system of government, and
are not controlled by any code of laws; each tribe or
village has a chief to whom a certain degree of respect
is conceded, but his power to restrain the people is very
limited; his influence over them is maintained chiefly
by his oratorical powers or military skill. In war the
tribe is guided by the chief's advice, and his authority
is fully recognized, but in time of peace his rule is
nominal; nor does he attempt to control their freedom
or punish them for offences. The chief's office is hereditary,
yet an unpopular ruler may be deposed and
another chosen to fill his place.<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WOMEN AMONG THE PUEBLOS.</p>

<p>Among the Pueblos the usual order of courtship is
reversed; when a girl is disposed to marry she does not
wait for a young man to propose to her, but selects one to
her own liking and consults her father, who visits the parents
of the youth and acquaints them with his daughter's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
wishes. It seldom happens that any objections to the
match are made, but it is imperative on the father of the
bridegroom to reimburse the parents of the maiden for
the loss of their daughter. This is done by an offer of
presents in accordance with his rank and wealth. The
inhabitants of one village seldom marry with those of
another, and, as a consequence, intermarriage is frequent
among these families&mdash;a fertile cause of their deterioration.
The marriage is always celebrated by a feast, the
provisions for which are furnished by the bride, and the
assembled friends unite in dancing and music. Polygamy
is never allowed, but married couples can separate
if they are dissatisfied with each other; in such a contingency,
if there are children, they are taken care of
by the grandparents, and both parties are free to marry
again; fortunately, divorces are not of frequent occurrence,
as the wives are always treated with respect by
their husbands.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> To the female falls all indoor work,
and also a large share of that to be done out of doors.
In the treatment of their children these people are careful
to guide them in the ways of honesty and industry,
and to impress their minds with chaste and virtuous
ideas. Mothers bathe their infants with cold water, and
boys are not permitted to enter the estufas for the purpose
of warming themselves; if they are cold they are
ordered to chop wood, or warm themselves by running
and exercise.<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> A girl's arrival at the age of puberty
among the Gila nations is a period of much rejoicing;
when the first symptoms appear, all her friends are duly
informed of the important fact, and preparations are
made to celebrate the joyful event. The girl is taken
by her parents to the prophet, who performs certain
ceremonies, which are supposed to drive the evil out of
her, and then a singing and dancing festival is held.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
When a young man sees a girl whom he desires for a
wife, he first endeavors to gain the good will of the
parents; this accomplished, he proceeds to serenade his
lady-love, and will often sit for hours, day after day,
near her house, playing on his flute. Should the girl
not appear it is a sign she rejects him; but if, on the
other hand, she comes out to meet him, he knows that
his suit is accepted, and he takes her to his house. No
marriage ceremony is performed. Among the Pápagos
the parents select a husband for their daughter to whom
she is, so to say, sold. It not unfrequently happens that
they offer their daughter at auction, and she is knocked
down to the highest bidder. However, among all the
nations of this family, whether the bridegroom makes a
love-match or not, he has to recompense the parents with
as much as his means will permit.<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Although polygamy
is not permitted, they often separate and marry again
at pleasure. Women, at the time of their confinement
as well as during their monthly periods, must live apart;
as they believe that if any male were to touch them, he
would become sick. The children are trained to war,
and but little attention given to teaching them useful
pursuits. All the household labor is performed by the
women; they also assist largely in the labors of the
field; severe laws oblige them to observe the strictest
chastity, and yet, at their festivals, much debauchery
and prostitution take place.<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>With but few exceptions, they are temperate in drinking
and smoking. Intoxicating liquors they prepare out
of the fruits of the pitahaya, agave, aloe, corn, mezcal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
prickly pear, wild and cultivated grapes. Colonel Cremony
says that the Pimas and Maricopas 'macerate the
fruit of the pitahaya (species of cactus) in water after
being dried in the sun, when the saccharine qualities
cause the liquid to ferment, and after such fermentation
it becomes highly intoxicating. It is upon this liquor
that the Maricopas and Pimas get drunk once a year,
the revelry continuing for a week or two at a time; but
it is also an universal custom with them to take regular
turns, so that only one third of the party is supposed to
indulge at one time, the remainder being required to
take care of their stimulated comrades, and protect
them from injuring each other or being injured by other
tribes.'<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> All are fond of dancing and singing; in their
religious rites, as well as in other public and family celebrations,
these form the chief diversion. Different
<span class="sidenote">PUEBLO DANCES.</span>
dances are used on different occasions; for example,
they have the arrow, scalp, turtle, fortune, buffalo, green-corn,
and Montezuma dances. Their costumes also vary
on each of these occasions, and not only are grotesque
masks, but also elk, bear, fox, and other skins used as
disguises. The dance is sometimes performed by only
one person, but more frequently whole tribes join in,
forming figures, shuffling, or hopping about to the time
given by the music. Lieutenant Simpson, who witnessed
a green-corn dance at the Jemez pueblo, describes
it as follows:</p>

<p>'When the performers first appeared, all of whom
were men, they came in a line, slowly walking and bending
and stooping as they approached. They were dressed
in a kirt of blanket, the upper portion of their bodies
being naked and painted red. Their legs and arms,
which were also bare, were variously striped with red,
white and blue colors; and around their arms, above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
the elbow, they wore a green band, decked with sprigs
of piñon. A necklace of the same description was worn
around the neck. Their heads were decorated with
feathers. In one hand they carried a dry gourd, containing
some grains of corn; in the other, a string from
which were hung several tortillas. At the knee were
fastened small shells of the ground turtle and antelope's
feet; and dangling from the back, at the waist, depended
a fox-skin. The party was accompanied by three elders
of the town, whose business it was to make a short
speech in front of the different houses, and, at particular
times, join in the singing of the rest of the party.
Thus they went from house to house, singing and
dancing, the occupants of each awaiting their arrival in
front of their respective dwellings.'</p>

<p>A somewhat similar Moqui dance is described by Mr
Ten Broeck. Some of the Pueblo dances end with
bacchanalia, in which not only general intoxication,
but promiscuous intercourse between the sexes is permitted.<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
'Once a year,' says Kendall, 'the Keres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
have a great feast, prepared for three successive days,
which time is spent in eating, drinking and dancing.
Near this scene of amusement is a dismal gloomy cave,
into which not a glimpse of light can penetrate, and
where places of repose are provided for the revellers.
To this cave, after dark, repair grown persons of every
age and sex, who pass the night in indulgences of the
most gross and sensual description.'</p>

<p>Reed flutes and drums are their chief instruments of
music; the former they immerse in a shallow basin of
water, and thereby imitate the warbling of birds. The
drum is made of a hollow log, about two and a half feet
long and fifteen inches in diameter. A dried hide,
from which previously the hair has been scraped, is
stretched over either end, and on this the player beats
with a couple of drumsticks, similar to those used on our
kettle-drums. Gourds filled with pebbles and other rattles,
are also used as a musical accompaniment to their
dances.<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS OF PIMAS AND PÁPAGOS.</p>

<p>The Cocomaricopas and Pimas are rather fond of
athletic sports, such as football, horse and foot racing,
swimming, target-shooting, and of gambling.<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
curious customs obtain among these people. Mr Walker
relates that a Pima never touches his skin with his
nails, but always uses a small stick for that purpose,
which he renews every fourth day, and wears in his
hair. Among the same nation, when a man has killed
an Apache, he must needs undergo purification. Sixteen
days he must fast, and only after the fourth day is he
allowed to drink a little pinole. During the sixteen
days he may not look on a blazing fire, nor hold converse
with mortal man; he must live in the woods companionless,
save only one person appointed to take care
of him. On the seventeenth day a large space is cleared
off near the village, in the center of which a fire is
lighted. The men form a circle round this fire, outside
of which those who have been purified sit, each in a
small excavation. Certain of the old men then take
the weapons of the purified and dance with them in the
circle; for which service they receive presents, and
thenceforth both slayer and weapon are considered clean,
but not until four days later is the man allowed to return
to his family. They ascribe the origin of this custom
to a mythical personage, called Szeukha, who, after killing
a monster, is said to have fasted for sixteen days.</p>

<p>The Pápagos stand in great dread of the coyote, and
the Pimas never touch an ant, snake, scorpion, or spider,
and are much afraid of thunderstorms. Like the Mojaves
and Yumas, the Maricopas in cold weather carry a
firebrand to warm themselves withal. In like manner
the Pueblos have their singularities and semi-religious
ceremonies, many of which are connected with a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
mythical personage called Montezuma. Among these
may be mentioned the perpetual watching of the eternal
estufa-fire, and also the daily waiting for the rising sun,
with which, as some writers affirm, they expectantly
look for the promised return of the much-loved Montezuma.
The Moqui, before commencing to smoke, reverently
bows toward the four cardinal points.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>Their diseases are few; and among these the most
frequent are chills and fevers, and later, syphilis. The
Pueblos and Moquis resort to the sweat-house remedy,
but the Pimas only bathe daily in cold running water.
Here, as elsewhere, the doctor is medicine-man, conjuror,
and prophet, and at times old women are consulted. If
incantations fail, emetics, purgatives, or blood-letting are
prescribed.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>The Pimas bury their dead immediately after death.
At the bottom of a shaft, about six feet deep, they excavate
a vault, in which the corpse is placed, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
having first been tied up in a blanket. House, horses,
and most personal effects are destroyed; but if children
are left, a little property is reserved for them. A widow
or a daughter mourns for three months, cutting the hair
and abstaining from the bath during that time. The
Maricopas burn their dead. Pueblo and Moqui burials
take place with many ceremonies, the women being the
chief mourners.<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE PUEBLOS.</p>

<p>Industrious, honest, and peace-loving, the people of
this division are at the same time brave and determined,
when necessity compels them to repel the thieving
Apache. Sobriety may be ranked among their virtues,
as drunkenness only forms a part of certain religious
festivals, and in their gambling they are the most moderate
of barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Lower Californians</span> present a sad picture. Occupying
the peninsula from the head of the gulf to Cape
San Lucas, it is thought by some that they were driven
thither from Upper California by their enemies. When
first visited by the Missionary Fathers, they presented
humanity in one of its lowest phases, though evidences
of a more enlightened people having at some previous
time occupied the peninsula were not lacking. Clavigero
describes large caves or vaults, which had been dug
out of the solid rock, the sides decorated with paintings
of animals and figures of men, showing dress and
features different from any of the inhabitants. Whom
they represented or by whom they were depicted there is
no knowledge, as the present race have been unable to
afford any information on the subject.</p>

<p class="sidenote">LOWER CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The peninsula extends from near 32° to 23° north
latitude; in length it is about seven hundred, varying
in width from thirty-five to eighty miles. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
general features are rugged; irregular mountains of
granite formation and volcanic upheavals traversing
the whole length of the country, with barren rocks and
sandy plains, intersected by ravines and hills. Some
fertile spots and valleys with clear mountain streams
are there, and in such places the soil produces abundantly;
then there are plains of greater or less extent,
with rich soil, but without water; so that, under the
circumstances, they are little more than deserts. These
plains rise in places into mesas, which are cut here and
there by cañons, where streams of water are found,
which are again lost on reaching the sandy plains.
Altogether, Lower California is considered as one of
the most barren and unattractive regions in the temperate
zone, although its climate is delightful, and the
mountain districts especially are among the healthiest
in the world, owing to their southern situation between
two seas. A curious meteorological phenomenon is
sometimes observed both in the gulf and on the land; it
is that of rain falling during a perfectly clear sky. Savants,
who have investigated the subject, do not appear
to have discovered the cause of this unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>The greater part of the peninsula, at the time of its
discovery, was occupied by the <i>Cochimís</i>, whose territory
extended from the head of the gulf to the neighborhood
of Loreto, or a little south of the twenty-sixth parallel;
adjoining them were the <i>Guaicuris</i>, living between latitude
26° and 23° 30´; while the <i>Pericúis</i> were settled
in the southern part, from about 23° 30´ or 24° to Cape
San Lucas, and on the adjacent islands.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span></p>

<p>The Lower Californians are well formed, robust and
of good stature, with limbs supple and muscular; they
are not inclined to corpulence; their features are somewhat
heavy, the forehead low and narrow, the nose well
set on, but thick and fleshy; the inner corners of the eyes
round instead of pointed; teeth very white and regular,
hair very black, coarse, straight, and glossy, with but
little on the face, and none upon the body or limbs.
The color of the skin varies from light to dark brown,
the former color being characteristic of the dwellers in
the interior, and the latter of those on the sea-coast.<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">COCHIMÍ AND PERICÚI DRESS.</p>

<p>Adam without the fig-leaves was not more naked than
were the Cochimís before the missionaries first taught
them the rudiments of shame. They ignored even the
usual breech-cloth, the only semblance of clothing being
a head-dress of rushes or strips of skin interwoven with
mother-of-pearl shells, berries, and pieces of reed. The
Guaicuris and Pericúis indulge in a still more fantastic
head-dress, white feathers entering largely into its
composition. The women display more modesty, for,
although scantily clad, they at least essay to cover their
nakedness. The Pericúi women are the best dressed
of all, having a petticoat reaching from the waist to the
ankles, made from the fibre of certain palm-leaves, and
rendered soft and flexible by beating between two stones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
Over the shoulders they throw a mantle of similar material,
or of plaited rushes, or of skins. The Cochimí
women make aprons of short reeds, strung upon cords
of aloe-plant fibres fastened to a girdle. The apron is
open at the sides, one part hanging in front, the other
behind. As they are not more than six or eight inches
wide, but little of the body is in truth covered. When
traveling they wear sandals of hide, which they fasten
with strings passed between the toes.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Both sexes are
fond of ornaments; to gratify this passion, they string
together pearls, shells, fruit-stones and seeds in the
forms of necklaces and bracelets. In addition to the
head-dress the Pericúis are distinguished by a girdle
highly ornamented with pearls and mother-of-pearl
shells. They perforate ears, lips, and nose, inserting in
the openings, shells, bones, or hard sticks. Paint in
many colors and devices is freely used on war and gala
occasions; tattooing obtains, but does not appear to be
universal among them. Mothers, to protect them against
the weather, cover the entire bodies of their children
with a varnish of coal and urine. Cochimí women cut
the hair short, but the men allow a long tuft to grow on
the crown of the head. Both sexes among the Guaicuris
and Pericúis wear the hair long and flowing loosely
over the shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>Equally Adamitic are their habitations. They appear
to hold a superstitious dread of suffocation if they live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
or sleep in covered huts; hence in their rare and meagre
attempts to protect themselves from the inclemencies of
the weather, they never put any roof over their heads.
Roving beast-like in the vicinity of springs during the
heat of the day, seeking shade in the ravines and overhanging
rocks; at night, should they desire shelter, they
resort to caverns and holes in the ground. During winter
they raise a semi-circular pile of stones or brushwood,
about two feet in height, behind which, with the
sky for a roof and the bare ground for a bed, they camp
at night. Over the sick they sometimes throw a wretched
hut, by sticking a few poles in the ground, tying them
at the top and covering the whole with grass and reeds,
and into this nest visitors crawl on hands and knees.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">LOWER CALIFORNIAN FOOD.</p>

<p>Reed-roots, wild fruit, pine-nuts, cabbage-palms, small
seeds roasted, and also roasted aloe and mescal roots
constitute their food. During eight weeks of the year
they live wholly on the redundant fat-producing <i>pitahaya</i>,
after which they wander about in search of other native
vegetable products, and when these fail they resort to
hunting and fishing. Of animal food they will eat anything&mdash;beasts,
birds, and fishes, or reptiles, worms, and
insects; and all parts: flesh, hide, and entrails. Men
and monkeys, however, as articles of food are an abomination;
the latter because they so much resemble the
former. The gluttony and improvidence of these people
exceed, if possible, those of any other nation; alternate
feasting and fasting is their custom. When so fortunate
as to have plenty they consume large quantities,
preserving none. An abominable habit is related of
them, that they pick up the undigested seeds of the pitahaya
discharged from their bowels, and after parching
and grinding them, eat the meal with much relish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
Clavigero, Baegert, and other authors, mention another
rather uncommon feature in the domestic economy of
the Cochimís; it is that of swallowing their meat several
times, thereby multiplying their gluttonous pleasures.
Tying to a string a piece of well-dried meat, one of their
number masticates it a little, and swallows it, leaving
the end of the string hanging out of the mouth; after
retaining it for about two or three minutes in his stomach,
it is pulled out, and the operation repeated several
times, either by the same individual or by others, until
the meat becomes consumed. Here is Father Baegert's
summary of their edibles: "They live now-a-days on
dogs and cats; horses, asses and mules; item: on owls,
mice and rats; lizards and snakes; bats, grasshoppers
and crickets; a kind of green caterpillar without hair,
about a finger long, and an abominable white worm of
the length and thickness of the thumb."<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>Their weapon is the bow and arrow, but they use
stratagem to procure the game. The deer-hunter deceives
his prey by placing a deer's head upon his own;
hares are trapped; the Cochimís throw a kind of boomerang
or flat curved stick, which skims the ground and
breaks the animal's legs. Fish are taken from pools left
by the tide and from the sea, sometimes several miles
out, in nets and with the aid of long lances. It is said
that at San Roche Island they catch fish with birds.
They also gather oysters, which they eat roasted, but use
no salt. They have no cooking utensils, but roast their
meat by throwing it into the fire and after a time raking
it out. Insects and caterpillars are parched over the
hot coals in shells. Fish is commonly eaten raw; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
drink only water.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> It is said that they never wash,
and it is useless to add that in their filthiness they surpass
the brutes.<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>Besides bows and arrows they use javelins, clubs, and
slings of cords, from which they throw stones. Their
bows are six feet long, very broad and thick in the middle
and tapering toward the ends, with strings made
from the intestines of animals. The arrows are reeds
about thirty inches in length, into the lower end of which
a piece of hard wood is cemented with resin obtained
from trees, and pointed with flint sharpened to a triangular
shape and serrated at the edges. Javelins are
sharpened by first hardening in the fire and then grinding
to a point; they are sometimes indented like a saw.
Clubs are of different forms, either mallet-head or axe
shape; they also crook and sharpen at the edge a piece
of wood in the form of a scimeter.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>Their wars, which spring from disputed boundaries,
are frequent and deadly, and generally occur about fruit
and seed time. The battle is commenced amidst yells
and brandishing of weapons, though without any preconcerted
plan, and a tumultuous onslaught is made without
regularity or discipline, excepting that a certain number
are held in reserve to relieve those who have expended
their arrows or become exhausted. While yet at a
distance they discharge their arrows, but soon rush forward
and fight at close quarters with their clubs and spears;
nor do they cease till many on both sides have fallen.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">IMPLEMENTS IN LOWER CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Their implements and household utensils are both
rude and few. Sharp flints serve them instead of knives;
a bone ground to a point answers the purpose of a needle
or an awl; and with a sharp-pointed stick roots are dug.
Fire is obtained in the usual way from two pieces of
wood. When traveling, water is carried in a large bladder.
The shell of the turtle is applied to various uses,
such as a receptacle for food and a cradle for infants.</p>

<p>The Lower Californians have little ingenuity, and
their display of mechanical skill is confined to the manufacture
of the aforesaid implements, weapons of war,
and of the chase; they make some flat baskets of wicker
work, which are used in the collection of seeds and
fruits; also nets from the fibre of the aloe, one in which
to carry provisions, and another fastened to a forked
stick and hung upon the back, in which to carry children.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>For boats the inhabitants of the peninsula construct
rafts of reeds made into bundles and bound tightly
together; they are propelled with short paddles, and seldom
are capable of carrying more than one person. In
those parts where trees grow a more serviceable canoe
is made from bark, and sometimes of three or more
logs, not hollowed out, but laid together side by side
and made fast with withes or pita-fibre cords. These
floats are buoyant, the water washing over them as over
a catamaran. On them two or more men will proceed
fearlessly to sea, to a distance of several miles from
the coast. To transport their chattels across rivers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
they use wicker-work baskets, which are so closely
woven as to be quite impermeable to water; these, when
loaded, are pushed across by the owner, who swims
behind.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<p>Besides their household utensils and boats, and the
feathers or ornaments on their persons, I find no other
property. They who dwell on the sea-coast occasionally
travel inland, carrying with them sea-shells and feathers
to barter with their neighbors for the productions of
the interior.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<p>They are unable to count more than five, and this
number is expressed by one hand; some few among
them are able to understand that two hands signify ten,
but beyond this they know nothing of enumeration, and
can only say much or many, or show that the number
is beyond computation, by throwing sand into the air
and such like antics. The year is divided into six seasons;
the first is called Mejibo, which is midsummer,
and the time of ripe pitahayas; the second season
Amaddappi, a time of further ripening of fruits and
seeds; the third Amadaappigalla, the end of autumn
and beginning of winter; the fourth, which is the coldest
season, is called Majibel; the fifth, when spring commences,
is Majiben; the sixth, before any fruits or seeds
have ripened, consequently the time of greatest scarcity,
is called Majiibenmaaji.<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<p>Neither government nor law is found in this region;
every man is his own master, and administers justice
in the form of vengeance as best he is able. As Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
Baegert remarks: 'The different tribes represented by
no means communities of rational beings, who submit
to laws and regulations and obey their superiors, but
resembled far more herds of wild swine, which run
about according to their own liking, being together to-day
and scattered to-morrow, till they meet again by
accident at some future time. In one word, the Californians
lived, <i>salva venia</i>, as though they had been free-thinkers
and materialists.' In hunting and war they
have one or more chiefs to lead them, who are selected
only for the occasion, and by reason of superior strength
or cunning.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MARRIAGE.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they have no marriage ceremony, nor
any word in their language to express marriage. Like
birds or beasts they pair off according to fancy. The
Pericúi takes as many women as he pleases, makes
them work for him as slaves, and when tired of any
one of them turns her away, in which case she may not
be taken by another. Some form of courtship appears
to have obtained among the Guaicuris; for example,
when a young man saw a girl who pleased him, he
presented her with a small bowl or basket made of the
pita-fibre; if she accepted the gift, it was an evidence
that his suit was agreeable to her, and in return she gave
him an ornamented head-dress, the work of her own
hand; then they lived together without further ceremony.
Although among the Guaicuris and Cochimís
some hold a plurality of wives, it is not so common as
with the Pericúis, for in the two first-mentioned tribes
there are more men than women. A breach of female
chastity is sometimes followed by an attempt of the
holder of the woman to kill the offender; yet morality
never attained any great height, as it is a practice
with them for different tribes to meet occasionally for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
the purpose of holding indiscriminate sexual intercourse.
Childbirth is easy; the Pericúis and Guaicuris wash the
body of the newly born, then cover it with ashes; as
the child grows it is placed on a frame-work of sticks,
and if a male, on its chest they fix a bag of sand to
prevent its breasts growing like a woman's, which they
consider a deformity. For a cradle the Cochimís take
a forked stick or bend one end of a long pole in the
form of a hoop, and fix thereto a net, in which the infant
is placed and covered with a second net. It can
thus be carried over the shoulder, or when the mother
wishes to be relieved, the end of the pole is stuck in the
ground, and nourishment given the child through the
meshes of the net. When old enough the child is carried
astride on its mother's shoulders. As soon as children
are able to get food for themselves, they are left to
their own devices, and it sometimes happens that when
food is scarce the child is abandoned, or killed by its
parents.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">LOWER CALIFORNIAN FEAST.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these miserables delight in feasts, and in
the gross debauchery there openly perpetrated. Unacquainted
with intoxicating liquors, they yet find drunkenness
in the fumes of a certain herb smoked through a
stone tube, and used chiefly during their festivals. Their
dances consist of a series of gesticulations and jumpings,
accompanied by inarticulate murmurings and yells. One
of their great holidays is the pitahaya season, when,
with plenty to eat, they spend days and nights in amusements;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
at such times feats of strength and trials of
speed take place. The most noted festival among the
Cochimís occurs upon the occasion of their annual distribution
of skins. To the women especially it was an
important and enjoyable event. Upon an appointed
day all the people collected at a designated place. In
an arbor constructed with branches, the road to which
was carpeted with the skins of wild animals that had
been killed during the year, their most skillful hunters
assembled; they alone were privileged to enter the
arbor, and in their honor was already prepared a banquet
and pipes of wild tobacco. The viands went round
as also the pipe, and, in good time, the partakers became
partially intoxicated by the smoke; then one of the
priests or sorcerers, arrayed in his robe of ceremony, appeared
at the entrance to the arbor, and made a speech
to the people, in which he recounted the deeds of the
hunters. Then the occupants of the arbor came out
and made a repartition of the skins among the women;
this finished, dancing and singing commenced and continued
throughout the night. It sometimes happened
that their festivals ended in fighting and bloodshed, as
they were seldom conducted without debauchery, especially
among the Guaicuris and Pericúis.<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></p>

<p>When they have eaten their fill they pass their time
in silly or obscene conversation, or in wrestling, in
which sports the women often take a part. They are
very adroit in tracking wild beasts to their lairs and
taming them. At certain festivals their sorcerers, who
were called by some <i>quamas</i>, by others <i>cusiyaes</i>, wore
long robes of skins, ornamented with human hair; these
sages filled the offices of priests and medicine-men, and
threatened their credulous brothers with innumerable
ills and death, unless they supplied them with provisions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
These favored of heaven professed to hold communication
with oracles, and would enter caverns and
wooded ravines, sending thence doleful sounds, to
frighten the people, who were by such tricks easily imposed
upon and led to believe in their deceits and juggleries.<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>As to ailments, Lower Californians are subject to
consumption, burning fevers, indigestion, and cutaneous
diseases. Small pox, measles, and syphilis, the last
imported by troops, have destroyed numberless lives.
Wounds inflicted by the bites of venomous reptiles may
be added to the list of troubles. Loss of appetite is
with them, generally, a symptom of approaching death.
They submit resignedly to the treatment prescribed by
their medicine-men, however severe or cruel it may be.
They neglect their aged invalids, refusing them attendance
if their last sickness proves too long, and recovery
appears improbable. In several instances they have put
an end to the patient by suffocation or otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>Diseases are treated externally by the application of
ointments, plasters, and fomentations of medicinal herbs,
particularly the wild tobacco. Smoke is also a great
panacea, and is administered through a stone tube placed
on the suffering part. The usual juggleries attend the
practice of medicine. In extreme cases they attempt to
draw with their fingers the disease from the patient's
mouth. If the sick person has a child or sister, they
cut its or her little finger of the right hand, and let the
blood drop on the diseased part. Bleeding with a sharp
stone and whipping the affected part with nettles, or
applying ants to it, are among the remedies used. For
the cure of tumors, the medicine-men burst and suck
them with their lips until blood is drawn. Internal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
diseases are treated with cold-water baths. The means
employed by the medicine-man are repeated by the
members of the patient's family and by his friends. In
danger even the imitation of death startles them. If
an invalid is pronounced beyond recovery, and he happens
to slumber, they immediately arouse him with blows
on the head and body, for the purpose of preserving
life.<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DEATH AND BURIAL IN LOWER CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Death is followed by a plaintive, mournful chant,
attended with howling by friends and relatives, who
beat their heads with sharp stones until blood flows
freely. Without further ceremony they either inter or
burn the body immediately, according to the custom of
the locality: in the latter case they leave the head
intact. Oftentimes they bury or burn the body before
life has actually left it, never taking pains to ascertain
the fact.<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Weapons and other personal effects are buried or
burned with the owner; and in some localities, where
burying is customary, shoes are put to the feet, so that
the spiritualized body may be prepared for its journey.
In Colechá and Guajamina mourning ceremonies are
practiced certain days after death&mdash;juggleries&mdash;in which
the priest pretends to hold converse with the departed
spirit through the scalp of the deceased, commending
the qualities of the departed, and concluding by asking
on the spirit's behalf that all shall cut off their hair as
a sign of sorrow. After a short dance, more howling,
hair-pulling, and other ridiculous acts, the priest demands
provisions for the spirit's journey, which his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
hearers readily contribute, and which the priest appropriates
to his own use, telling them it has already started.
Occasionally they honor the memory of their dead by
placing a rough image of the departed on a high pole,
and a <i>quama</i> or priest sings his praises.<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>The early missionaries found the people of the peninsula
kind-hearted and tractable, although dull of
comprehension and brutal in their instincts, rude, narrow-minded,
and inconstant. A marked difference of
character is observable between the Cochimís and the
Pericúis. The former are more courteous in their manners
and better behaved; although cunning and thievish,
they exhibit attachment and gratitude to their superiors;
naturally indolent and addicted to childish pursuits and
amusements, they lived among themselves in amity,
directing their savage and revengeful nature against
neighboring tribes with whom they were at variance.
The Pericúis, before they became extinct, were a fierce
and barbarous nation, unruly and brutal in their passions,
cowardly, treacherous, false, petulant, and boastful,
with an intensely cruel and heartless disposition,
often shown in relentless persecutions and murders.
In their character and disposition the Guaicuris did not
differ essentially from the Pericúis. In the midst of
so much darkness there was still one bright spot visible,
inasmuch as they were of a cheerful and happy nature,
lovers of kind and lovers of country. Isolated, occupying
an ill-favored country, it was circumstances, rather
than any inherent incapacity for improvement, that held
these poor people in their low state; for, as we shall see
at some future time, in their intercourse with civilized
foreigners, they were not lacking in cunning, diplomacy,
selfishness, and other aids to intellectual progress.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>

<p class="sidenote">NORTHERN MEXICANS.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Northern Mexicans</span>, the fourth and last division
of this group, spread over the territory lying between
parallels 31° and 23° of north latitude. Their lands have
an average breadth of about five hundred miles, with an
area of some 250,000 square miles, comprising the states
of Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Nuevo Leon,
and the northern portions of Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí
and Tamaulipas.</p>

<p>Nearly parallel with the Pacific seaboard, and dividing
the states of Sonora and Sinaloa from Chihuahua
and Durango, runs the great central Cordillera; further
to the eastward, passing through Coahuila, Nuevo Leon,
and San Luis Potosí, and following the shore line of the
Mexican Gulf, the Sierra Madre continues in a southerly
direction, until it unites with the first-named range
at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. All of these mountains
abound in mineral wealth. The table-land between
them is intersected by three ridges; one, the Sierra Mimbres,
issuing from the inner flank of the Western Cordillera
north of Arispe, extending in a northerly direction
and following the line of the Rio Grande. The
middle mountainous divide crosses from Durango to Coahuila,
while the third rises in the state of Jalisco and
taking an easterly and afterward northerly direction,
traverses the table-land and merges into the Sierra
Madre in the state of San Luis Potosí. On these broad
table-lands are numerous lakes fed by the streams which
have their rise in the mountains adjacent; in but few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
spots is the land available for tillage, but it is admirably
adapted to pastoral purposes. The climate can hardly
be surpassed in its tonic and exhilarating properties;
the atmosphere is ever clear, with sunshine by day, and
a galaxy of brilliant stars by night; the absence of rain,
fogs, and dews, with a delicious and even temperature,
renders habitations almost unnecessary. All this vast
region is occupied by numerous tribes speaking different
languages and claiming distinct origins. Upon the
northern seaboard of Sonora and Tiburon Island are
the <i>Ceris</i>, <i>Tiburones</i>, and <i>Tepocas</i>; south of them the
<i>Cahitas</i>, or <i>Sinaloas</i>, which are general names for the
<i>Yaquis</i> and <i>Mayos</i>, tribes so called from the rivers on
whose banks they live. In the state of Sinaloa there
are also the <i>Cochitas</i>, <i>Tuvares</i>, <i>Sabaibos</i>, <i>Zuaques</i>, and
<i>Ahomes</i>, besides many other small tribes. Scattered
through the states of the interior are the <i>Ópatas</i>, <i>Eudeves</i>,
<i>Jovas</i>, <i>Tarahumares</i>, <i>Tubares</i>, and <i>Tepehuanes</i>, who
inhabit the mountainous districts of Chihuahua and
Durango. East of the Tarahumares, in the northern
part of the first-named state, dwell the <i>Conchos</i>.
In Durango, living in the hills round Topia, are the
<i>Acaxées</i>; south of whom dwell the <i>Xiximes</i>. On the
table-lands of Mapimi and on the shores of its numerous
lakes, the <i>Irritilas</i> and many other tribes are settled;
while south of these again, in Zacatecas and San Luis
Potosí, are the <i>Guachichiles</i>, <i>Huamares</i>, and <i>Cazcanes</i>, and
further to the east, and bordering on the gulf shores we
find the country occupied by scattered tribes, distinguished
by a great variety of names, prominent among
which are the <i>Carrizas</i> or <i>Garzas</i>, <i>Xanambres</i>, and <i>Pintos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL PECULIARITIES IN NORTH MEXICO.</p>

<p>Most of these nations are composed of men of large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
stature; robust, and well formed, with an erect carriage;
the finest specimens are to be found on the sea-coast,
exceptions being the Ópatas and Chicoratas, the former
inclining to corpulency, the latter being short, although
active and swift runners. The women are well limbed
and have good figures, but soon become corpulent. The
features of these people are quite regular, the head round
and well shaped, with black and straight hair; they have
high cheek-bones and handsome mouths, with a generally
mild and pleasing expression of countenance.
They have piercing black eyes, and can distinguish objects
at great distances. The Ceris see best toward the
close of the day, owing to the strong reflection from the
white sands of the coast during the earlier part of the
day. The Carrizas are remarkable for their long upper
lip. The men of this region have little beard; their complexion
varies from a light brown to a copper shade.
Many of them attain to a great age.<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>For raiment the Cahitas and Ceris wear only a small
rag in front of their persons, secured to a cord tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
round the waist; the Tarahumares, Acaxées, and other
nations of the interior use for the same purpose a square
piece of tanned deer-skin painted, except in cold weather,
when they wrap a large blue cotton mantle round the
shoulders. The women have petticoats reaching to their
ankles, made of soft chamois or of cotton or agave-fibre,
and a <i>tilma</i> or mantle during the winter. Some wear a
long sleeveless chemise, which reaches from the shoulders
to the feet. The Ceri women have petticoats made from
the skins of the albatross or pelican, the feathers inside.
The Ópata men, soon after the conquest, were found
well clad in blouse and drawers of cotton, with wooden
shoes, while their neighbors wore sandals of raw hide,
cut to the shape of the foot.<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>The Cahitas, Acaxées and most other tribes, pierce
the ears and nose, from which they hang small green
stones, attached to a piece of blue cord; on the head,
neck, and wrists, a great variety of ornaments are worn,
made from mother-of-pearl and white snails' shells, also
fruit-stones, pearls, and copper and silver hoops; round
the ankles some wear circlets of deer's hoofs, others
decorate their heads and necks with necklaces of red
beans and strings of paroquets and small birds; pearls
and feathers are much used to ornament the hair. The
practice of painting the face and body is common to all,
the colors most in use being red and black. A favorite
style with the Ceris is to paint the face in alternate perpendicular
stripes of blue, red, and white. The Pintos
paint the face, breast, and arms; the Tarahumares tattoo
the forehead, lips, and cheeks in various patterns; the
Yaquis the chin and arms; while other tribes tattoo the
face or body in styles peculiar to themselves. Both
sexes are proud of their hair, which they wear long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
take much care of; the women permit it to flow, in loose
tresses, while the men gather it into one or more tufts on
the crown of the head, and when hunting protect it by
a chamois cap, to prevent its being disarranged by trees
or bushes.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NORTHERN MEXICAN DWELLINGS.</p>

<p>Their houses are of light construction, usually built
of sticks and reeds, and are covered with coarse reed
matting. The Chinipas, Yaquis, Ópatas and Conchos
build somewhat more substantial dwellings of timber and
adobes, or of plaited twigs well plastered with mud; all
are only one story high and have flat roofs. Although
none of these people are without their houses or huts,
they spend most of their time, especially during summer,
under the trees. The Tarahumares find shelter in
the deep caverns of rocky mountains, the Tepehuanes
and Acaxées place their habitations on the top of almost
inaccessible crags, while the Humes and Batucas build
their villages in squares, with few and very small entrances,
the better to defend themselves against their
enemies&mdash;detached buildings for kitchen and store-room
purposes being placed contiguous.<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span></p>

<p>The Northern Mexicans live chiefly on wild fruits
such as the pitahaya, honey, grain, roots, fish, and
larvæ; they capture game both large and small, and
some of them eat rats, mice, frogs, snakes, worms, and
vermin. The Ahomamas along the shores of Lake
Parras, the Yaquis, Batucas, Ceris, Tarahumares, and
the Ópatas since the conquest have become agriculturists
and cattle-breeders, besides availing themselves
of fishing and hunting as means of subsistence. On the
coast of Sonora, there being no maize, the natives live
on pulverized rush and straw, with fish caught at sea or
in artificial enclosures. The dwellers on the coast of
Sinaloa consume a large quantity of salt, which they
gather on the land during the dry season, and in the
rainy reason from the bottom of marshes and pools. It
is said that the Salineros sometimes eat their own excrement.
According to the reports of the older historians,
the Tobosos, Bauzarigames, Cabezas, Contotores, and
Acaxées, as well as other tribes of Durango and Sinaloa,
formerly fed on human flesh,&mdash;hunted human beings
for food as they hunted deer or other game. The flesh
of their brave foes they ate, thinking thereby to augment
their own bravery.<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">METHODS OF HUNTING.</p>

<p>The Ceris of Tiburon Island depend for food entirely
on fish and game. They catch turtle by approaching
the animal and suddenly driving the point of their spear
into its back, a cord being attached to the weapon by
which they drag the prize on to the raft as soon as its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
strength has become exhausted. According to Gomara,
the natives of Sonora in 1537 were caught poisoning
the deer-pools, probably for the skins, or it may have
been only a stupefying drink that the pools were made
to supply. The Sinaloans are great hunters; at times
they pursue the game singly, then again the whole town
turns out and, surrounding the thickest part of the forest,
the people set fire to the underbrush and bring
down the game as it attempts to escape the flames. A
feast of reptiles is likewise thus secured. Iguanas are
caught with the hands, their legs broken, and thus they
are kept until required for food. For procuring wild
honey, a bee is followed until it reaches its tree, the sweet-containing
part of which is cut off and carried away.
The Tarahumares hunt deer by driving them through
narrow passes, where men are stationed to shoot them.
Others make use of a deer's head as a decoy. For fishing
they have various contrivances; some fish between
the rocks with a pointed stick; others, when fishing in
a pool, throw into the water a species of cabbage or
leaves of certain trees, that stupefy the fish, when they
are easily taken with the hands; they also use wicker
baskets, and near the Pacific Ocean they inclose the
rivers, and catch enormous quantities of smelt and other
fish, which have come up from the sea to spawn. The
Laguneros of Coahuila catch ducks by placing a calabash
on their heads, with holes through which to breathe and
see; thus equipped, they swim softly among the ducks,
and draw them under water without flutter or noise.
Tatéma is the name of a dish cooked in the ground by
the Tarahumares. The Laguneros make tortillas of
flour obtained from an aquatic plant. The Zacatecs
make the same kind of bread from the pulp of the maguey,
which is first boiled with lime, then washed and
boiled again in pure water, after which it is squeezed dry
and made into cakes. Most of the people use <i>pozole</i>, or
<i>pinolatl</i>, both being a kind of gruel made of pinole, of
parched corn or seeds ground, the one of greater thickness
than the other; also <i>tamales</i>, boiled beans, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
pumpkins. The Ceris of Tiburon eat fish and meat uncooked,
or but slightly boiled. The Salineros frequently
devour uncooked hares and rabbits, having only removed
their furs.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HOW ARROWS WERE MADE AND POISONED.</p>

<p>The weapons universally used by these nations were
bows and arrows and short clubs, in addition to which
the chiefs and most important warriors carried a short
lance and a buckler. The arrows were carried in a
quiver made of lion or other skins. The Tarahumares
and some others wore a leathern guard round the left
wrist, to protect it from the blow of the bow-string.
Flint knives were employed for cutting up their slain
enemies. The Ceris, Jovas, and other tribes smeared the
points of their arrows with a very deadly poison, but
how it was applied to the point, or whence obtained, it is
difficult to determine; some travelers say that this
poison was taken from rattlesnakes and other venomous
reptiles, which, by teasing, were incited to strike their
fangs into the liver of a cow or deer which was presented
to them, after which it was left to putrefy, and the arrows
being dipped into the poisonous mass, were placed in
the sun to dry; but other writers, again, assert that the
poison was produced from a vegetable preparation. The
wound inflicted by the point, however slight, is said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
have caused certain death. The arrows were pointed
with flint, or some other stone, or with bone, fastened to
a piece of hard wood, which is tied by sinews to a reed
or cane, notched, and winged with three feathers; when
not required for immediate use, the tying was loosed,
and the point reversed in the cane, to protect it from
being broken. The Ceris and Chicoratos cut a notch a
few inches above the point, so that in striking it should
break off and remain in the wound. Their clubs were
made of a hard wood called <i>guayacan</i>, with a knob at
the end, and when not in use were carried slung to the
arm by a leather thong. Their lances were of Brazil
wood, bucklers of alligator-skin, and shields of bull's
hide, sufficiently large to protect the whole body, with a
hole in the top to look through. Another kind of shield
was made of small lathes closely interwoven with cords,
in such a manner that, when not required for use, it
could be shut up like a fan, and was carried under the
arm.<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>Living in a state of constant war, arising out of family
quarrels or aggressions made into each other's territories,
they were not unskilled in military tactics. Previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
to admission as a warrior, a young man had to pass
through certain ordeals; having first qualified himself
by some dangerous exploit, or having faithfully performed
the duty of a scout in an enemy's country. The
preliminaries being settled, a day was appointed for
his initiation, when one of the braves, acting as his godfather,
introduced him to the chief, who, for the occasion,
had first placed himself in the midst of a large circle of
warriors. The chief then addressed him, instructing
him in the several duties required of him, and drawing
from a pouch an eagle's talon, with it proceeded to score
his body on the shoulders, arms, breast, and thighs, till
the blood ran freely; the candidate was expected to suffer
without showing the slightest signs of pain. The
chief then handed to him a bow and a quiver of arrows;
each of the braves also presented him with two arrows.
In the campaigns that followed, the novitiate must take
the hardest duty, be ever at the post of danger, and
endure without a murmur or complaint the severest privations,
until a new candidate appeared to take his
place.<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR CUSTOMS IN NORTH MEXICO.</p>

<p>When one tribe desires the assistance of another in
war, they send reeds filled with tobacco, which, if
accepted, is a token that the alliance is formed; a call
for help is made by means of the smoke signal. When
war is decided upon, a leader is chosen, at whose house
all the elders, medicine-men, and principal warriors
assemble; a fire is then lighted, and tobacco handed
round and smoked in silence. The chief, or the most
aged and distinguished warrior then arises, and in a
loud tone and not unpoetic language, harangues his
hearers, recounting to them heroic deeds hitherto performed,
victories formerly gained, and present wrongs to
be avenged; after which tobacco is again passed round,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
and new speakers in turn address the assembly. War
councils are continued for several nights, and a day is
named on which the foe is to be attacked. Sometimes
the day fixed for the battle is announced to the enemy,
and a spot on which the fight is to take place selected.
During the campaign fasting is strictly observed. The
Acaxées, before taking the war-path, select a maiden of
the tribe, who secludes herself during the whole period
of the campaign, speaking to no one, and eating nothing
but a little parched corn without salt. The Ceris and
Ópatas approach their enemy under cover of darkness,
preserving a strict silence, and at break of day, by a
preconcerted signal, a sudden and simultaneous attack is
made. To fire an enemy's house, the Tepagues and
others put lighted corn-cobs on the points of their
arrows. In the event of a retreat they invariably carry
off the dead, as it is considered a point of honor not to
leave any of their number on the field. Seldom is sex
or age spared, and when prisoners are taken, they are
handed over to the women for torture, who treat them
most inhumanly, heaping upon them every insult devisable,
besides searing their flesh with burning brands,
and finally burning them at the stake, or sacrificing them
in some equally cruel manner. Many cook and eat
the flesh of their captives, reserving the bones as trophies.
The slain are scalped, or a hand is cut off, and
a dance performed round the trophies on the field of
battle. On the return of an expedition, if successful,
entry into the village is made in the day-time. Due
notice of their approach having been forwarded to the
inhabitants, the warriors are received with congratulations
and praises by the women, who, seizing the scalps,
vent their spleen in frantic gestures; tossing them
from one to another, these female fiends dance and sing
round the bloody trophies, while the men look on in
approving silence. Should the expedition, however,
prove unsuccessful, the village is entered in silence and
during the dead of night. All the booty taken is
divided amongst the aged men and women, as it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
deemed unlucky by the warriors to use their enemy's
property.<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<p>Their household utensils consist of pots of earthen
ware and gourds, the latter used both for cooking and
drinking purposes; later, out of the horns of oxen cups
are made. The Tarahumares use in place of saddles
two rolls of straw fastened by a girdle to the animal's
back, loose enough, however, to allow the rider to put
his feet under them. Emerging from their barbarism,
they employ, in their agricultural pursuits, plows with
shares of wood or stone, and wooden hoes. The Ceris
have a kind of double-pointed javelin, with which they
catch fish, which, once between the prongs, are prevented
from slipping out by the jagged sides.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p>The Ahomoas, Eudebes, Jovas, Yaquis, and Ópatas
weave fabrics out of cotton or agave-fibre, such as blankets
or serapes, and cloth with colored threads in neat
designs and figures; these nations also manufacture matting
from reeds and palm-leaves. Their loom consists of
four short sticks driven into the ground, to which a frame
is attached to hold the thread. The shuttle is an oblong
piece of wood, on which the cross-thread is wound.
After passing through the web, the shuttle is seized and
pressed close by a ruler three inches in breadth, which
is placed between the web and supplies the place of
a comb. When any patterns are to be worked, several
women assist to mark off with wooden pegs the amount
of thread required. The Yaquis and Ceris manufacture
common earthen ware, and the Tarahumares twist horse-hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
into strong cords; they also use undressed hides cut
in strips, and coarse aloe-fibres.<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PROPERTY OF CERIS, ÓPATAS, AND YAQUIS.</p>

<p>No boats or canoes are employed by any of the natives
of this region; but the Ceris, the Tiburones, and
the Tepocas make rafts of reeds or bamboos, fastened
together into bundles. These rafts are about eighteen
feet long and tapering toward both ends; some are large
enough to carry four or five men; they are propelled
with a double-bladed paddle, held in the middle and
worked alternately on both sides.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

<p>Subsequent to the conquest, the Ópatas and Yaquis
accumulated large flocks of sheep, cattle, and bands of
horses; the latter are good miners, and expert divers for
pearls. Their old communistic ideas follow them in
their new life; thus, the landed property of the Tarahumares
is from time to time repartitioned; they have
also a public asylum for the sick, helpless, and for orphans,
who are taken care of by male and female officials
called <i>tenanches</i>. Pearls, turquoises, emeralds, coral,
feathers, and gold were in former times part of their
property, and held the place of money; trade, for the
most part, was carried on by simple barter.<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>The Northern Mexicans make no pretensions to art;
nevertheless, Guzman states that in the province of
Culiacan the walls of the houses were decorated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
obscene paintings. They are all great observers of the
heavenly bodies and the changes in the atmosphere;
the Yaquis count their time by the moon. They are
good musicians, imitating to perfection on their own instruments
almost any strain they happen to hear. Their
native melodies are low, sweet, and harmonious. In
Petatlan they embroidered dresses with pearls, and as
they had no instrument for piercing the jewel, they cut
a small groove round it, and so strung them. With
pearls they formed on cloth figures of animals and
birds.<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>I find nowhere in this region any system of laws or
government. There are the usual tribal chieftains,
selected on account of superior skill or bravery, but with
little or no power except in war matters. Councils
of war, and all meetings of importance, are held at the
chief's house.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MARRIAGE AND POLYGAMY.</p>

<p>The Ceris and Tepocas celebrate the advent of womanhood
with a feast, which lasts for several days. The
Ahome maiden wears on her neck a small carved shell,
as a sign of her virginity, to lose which before marriage
is a lasting disgrace. On the day of marriage the bridegroom
removes this ornament from his bride's neck. It
is customary among most of the tribes to give presents
to the girl's parents. The Tahus, says Castañeda, are
obliged to purchase a maiden from her parents, and
deliver her to the <i>cacique</i>,<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> chief, or possibly high priest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
to whom was accorded the <i>droit de seigneur</i>. If the
bride proves to be no virgin, all the presents are returned
by her parents, and it is optional with the bridegroom to
keep her or condemn her to the life of a public prostitute.
The Bauzarigames, Cabezas, Contotores, and
Tehuecos practice polygamy and inter-family marriages,
but these are forbidden by the Ceris, Chinipas, Tiburones,
and Tepocas. Different ceremonies take place
upon the birth of the first child. Among some, the
father is intoxicated, and in that state surrounded by a
dancing multitude, who score his body till the blood
flows freely. Among others, several days after the birth
of a male child, the men visit the house, feel each limb
of the newly born, exhort him to be brave, and finally
give him a name; women perform similar ceremonies
with female children. The couvade obtains in certain
parts; as for instance, the Lagunero and Ahomama
husbands, after the birth of a child, remain in bed for
six or seven days, during which time they eat neither
fish nor meat. The Sisibotaris, Ahomes, and Tepehuanes
hold chastity in high esteem, and both their maidens
and matrons are remarkably chaste. The standard
of morality elsewhere in this vicinity is in general low,
especially with the Acaxées and Tahus, whose incestuous
connections and system of public brothels are notorious.
According to Arlegui, Ribas, and other authors, among
some of these nations male concubinage prevails to a
great extent; these loathsome semblances of humanity,
whom to call beastly were a slander upon beasts, dress
themselves in the clothes and perform the functions of
women, the use of weapons even being denied them.<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span></p>

<p>Drunkenness prevails to a great extent among most of
the tribes; their liquors are prepared from the fruit of
the pitahaya, mezquite-beans, agave, honey, and wheat.
In common with all savages, they are immoderately fond
of dancing, and have numerous feasts, where, with obscene
carousals and unseemly masks, the revels continue,
until the dancers, from sheer exhaustion or intoxication,
are forced to rest. The Ópatas hold a festival called
<i>torom raqui</i>, to insure rain and good crops. Clearing a
square piece of ground, they strew it with seeds, bones,
boughs, horns, and shells; the actors then issue forth
from huts built on the four corners of the square, and
there dance from sunrise to sunset. On the first day of
the year they plant in the ground a tall pole, to which
are tied long ribbons of many colors. A number of
young maidens, fancifully attired, dance round the pole,
holding the ends of the ribbons, twisting themselves
nearer or away from the center in beautiful figures.
Upon other occasions they commemorate, in modern
times, what is claimed to be the journey of the Aztecs,
and the appearance of Montezuma among them. Hunting
and war expeditions are inaugurated by dances.
Their musical instruments are flutes and hollow trunks
beaten with sticks or bones, and accompanied with song
and impromptu words, relating the exploits of their
gods, warriors, and hunters. They are passionately
fond of athletic sports, such as archery, wrestling, and
racing; but the favorite pastime is a kind of foot-ball.
The game is played between two parties, with a large
elastic ball, on a square piece of ground prepared expressly
for the purpose. The players must strike the
ball with the shoulders, knees, or hips, but never with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
the hand. Frequently one village challenges another
as upon the occasion of a national festival, which lasts
several days, and is accompanied with dancing and
feasting. They have also games with wooden balls, in
which sticks are used when playing. The players are
always naked, and the game often lasts from sunrise to
sunset, and sometimes, when the victory is undecided,
the play will be continued for several successive days.
Bets are freely made, and horses and other property
staked with the greatest recklessness.<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS IN NORTHERN MEXICO.</p>

<p>Loads are carried on the head, or in baskets at the
back, hanging from a strap that passes across the forehead.
Another mode of carrying burdens is to distribute
equally the weight at both ends of a pole which
is slung across the shoulder, <i>à la Chinoise</i>. Their conceptions
of the supernatural are extremely crude; thus, the
Ópatas, by yells and gesticulations, endeavor to dispel
eclipses of the heavenly bodies; before the howling of
the wind they cower as before the voice of the Great
Spirit. The Ceris superstitiously celebrate the new
moon, and bow reverentially to the rising and setting
sun. Nuño de Guzman states that in the province of
Culiacan tamed serpents were found in the dwellings of
the natives, which they feared and venerated. Others
have a great veneration for the hidden virtues of poisonous
plants, and believe that if they crush or destroy
one, some harm will happen to them. It is a common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
custom to hang a small bag containing poisonous herbs
round the neck of a child, as a talisman against diseases
or attacks from wild beasts, which they also believe will
render them invulnerable in battle. They will not touch
a person struck by lightning, and will leave him to die,
or, if dead, to lie unburied.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>

<p>Intermittent and other fevers prevail among the people
of Northern Mexico. Small-pox, introduced by
Europeans, has destroyed many lives; syphilis was introduced
among the Carrizos by the Spanish troops.
The Tarahumares suffer from pains in the side about the
end of the spring. The Ópatas of Oposura are disfigured
by goitres, but this disease seems to be confined
within three leagues of the town. Wounds inflicted by
arrows, many of them poisoned, and bites of rattlesnakes
are common. Friends, and even parents and
brothers leave to their fate such as are suffering from
contagious diseases; they, however, place water and wild
fruits within the sufferer's reach. To relieve their
wearied legs and feet after long marches, they scarify
the former with sharp flints. In extreme cases they
rub themselves with the maguey's prickly leaf well
pounded, which, acting as an emollient on their hardened
bodies, affords them prompt relief. The Carrizos cure
syphilis with certain plants, the medicinal properties of
which are known to them. As a purgative they use the
grains of the <i>maguacate</i>, and as a febrifuge the <i>cenicilla</i>
(<i>teraina frutescens</i>). With the leaves of the latter
they make a decoction which, mixed with hydromel, is
an antidote for intermittent fevers. They also use the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
leaves of the willow in decoction, as a remedy for the
same complaint. In Sinaloa, the leaf and roots of the
<i>guaco</i> are used by the natives as the most efficacious
medicine for the bites of poisonous reptiles. The Ópatas
employ excellent remedies for the diseases to which they
are subject. They have a singular method of curing
rattlesnake bites, a sort of retaliative cure; seizing the
reptile's head between two sticks, they stretch out the
tail and bite it along the body, and if we may believe
Alegre, the bitten man does not swell up, but the reptile
does, until it bursts. In some parts, if a venomous snake
bites a person, he seizes it at both ends, and breaks
all its bones with his teeth until it is dead, imagining
this to be an efficacious means of saving himself from
the effect of the wounds. Arrow wounds are first
sucked, and then <i>peyote</i> powder is put into them; after
two days the wound is cleaned, and more of the same
powder applied; this operation is continued upon every
second day, and finally powdered lechugilla-root is used;
by this process the wound, after thoroughly suppurating,
becomes healed. Out of the leaves of the maguey,
lechugilla, and date-palm, as well as from the rosemary,
they make excellent balsams for curing wounds. They
have various vegetable substances for appeasing the thirst
of wounded persons, as water is considered injurious.
The Acaxées employ the sucking processes, and blowing
through a hollow tube, for the cure of diseases. The
Yaquis put a stick into the patient's mouth, and with it
draw from the stomach the disease; the Ceris of Tiburon
Island also employ charms in their medical practice.<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>I find nothing of cremation in these parts. The
dead body is brought head and knees together, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>
placed in a cave or under a rock. Several kinds of edibles,
with the utensils and implements with which the deceased
earned a support while living, are deposited in
the grave, also a small idol, to serve as a guide and fellow
traveler to the departed on the long journey. On
the lips of dead infants is dropped milk from the
mother's breast, that these innocents may have sustenance
to reach their place of rest. Among the Acaxées,
if a woman dies in childbirth, the infant surviving is
slain, as the cause of its mother's death. Cutting the
hair is the only sign of mourning among them.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER.</p>

<p>The character of the Northern Mexicans, as portrayed
by Arlegui, is gross and low; but some of these tribes
do not deserve such sweeping condemnation. The
Mayos, Yaquis, Acaxées, and Ópatas are generally intelligent,
honest, social, amiable, and intrepid in war;
their young women modest, with a combination of sweetness
and pride noticed by some writers. The Ópatas
especially are a hard-working people, good-humored, free
from intemperance and thievishness; they are also very
tenacious of purpose, when their minds are made up&mdash;danger
often strengthening their stubbornness the
more. The Sisibotaris, Ahomamas, Onavas, and Tarahumares
are quiet and docile, but brave when occasion
requires; the last-mentioned are remarkably honest.
The Tepocas and Tiburones are fierce, cruel, and
treacherous, more warlike and courageous than the
Ceris of the main land, who are singularly devoid of
good qualities, being sullenly stupid, lazy, inconstant,
revengeful, depredating, and much given to intemperance.
Their country even has become a refuge for evil-doers.
In former times they were warlike and brave:
but even this quality they have lost, and have become as
cowardly as they are cruel. The Tepehuanes and other
mountaineers are savage and warlike, and their animosity
to the whites perpetual. The Laguneros and other tribes
of Coahuila are intelligent, domestic, and hospitable;
the former especially are very brave. In Chihuahua
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
they are generally fierce and uncommunicative. At El
Paso, the women are more jovial and pleasant than the
men; the latter speak but little, never laugh, and seldom
smile; their whole aspect seems to be wrapped in melancholy&mdash;everything
about it has a semblance of sadness
and suffering.<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

the valley upon the south, and is called Asientic-häbî, or first range; 2d,
the heights that bound the right bank of the Colorado north of the Mojave
villages, termed Havic-häbî, or second range; and, 3d, the Blue Ridge, extending

<span class="s08">WILD TRIBES OF MEXICO.</span></h3>

<p class="ch_summ">
<span class="smcap">Territorial Aspects&mdash;Two Main Divisions; Wild Tribes of Central
Mexico, and Wild Tribes of Southern Mexico&mdash;The Coras and
others in Jalisco&mdash;Descendants of the Aztecs&mdash;The Otomís
and Mazahuas adjacent to the Valley of Mexico&mdash;The Pames&mdash;
The Tarascos and Matlaltzincas of Michoacan&mdash;The Huaztecs and
Totonacs of Vera Cruz and Tamaulipas&mdash;The Chontales, Chinantecs,
Mazatecs, Cuicatecs, Chatinos, Miztecs, Zapotecs, Mijes, Huaves,
Chiapanecs, Zoques, Lacandones, Choles, Mames, Tzotziles, Tzendales,
Chochones, and others of Southern Mexico.</span></p>

<p>The term <span class="smcap">Wild Tribes of Mexico</span>, which I employ
to distinguish this from the other groupal divisions of
the Native Races of the Pacific States needs some explanation.
The territory embraced under this title extends
from latitude 23° north, to the eighteenth parallel
on the Atlantic, and the fifteenth on the Pacific; that is
to the Central American line, including Yucatan and
excluding Guatemala. At the time of the conquest, a
large portion of this region as well as part of Central
America was occupied by those nations that we call civilized,
which are fully described in the second volume of
this work. These several precincts of civilization may
be likened to suns, shining brightly at their respective
centres, and radiating into the surrounding darkness
with greater or less intensity according to distance and
circumstances. The bloody conquest achieved, these
suns were dimmed, their light went out; part of this civilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
merged into that of the conquerors, and
part fell back into the more distant darkness. Later
many of the advanced aboriginals became more and more
identified with the Spaniards; the other natives soon
came to be regarded as savages, who, once pacified,
spread over the seat of their nation's former grandeur,
obliterating many of the traces of their peoples' former
high advancement;&mdash;so that very shortly after the
Spaniards became masters of the land, any description
of its aborigines could but be a description of its savage
nations, or of retrograded, or partially obliterated peoples
of higher culture. And thus I find it, and thus must
treat the subject, going over the whole territory almost
as if there had been no civilization at all.</p>

<p>For variety and striking contrasts the climate and
scenery of central and southern Mexico is surpassed by
no region of equal extent in the world. It is here that
the tierra caliente, or hot border-land of either ocean,
the tierra templada, or temperate belt adjacent, and the
tierra fria, or cool elevated table-land assume their most
definite forms. The interior table-lands have an average
elevation above the sea of from 5,000 to 8,000 feet.
The geological formation is on a Titanic scale; huge rocks
of basalt, granite, and lava rise in fantastic shapes, intersected
by deep barrancas or ravines presenting unparalleled
scenes of grandeur. Prominent among the
surrounding mountains tower the snow-clad crests of
Orizaba and Popocatepetl,&mdash;volcanic piles whose slumbering
fires appear to be taking but a temporary rest.
The plateau is variegated with many lakes; the soil,
almost everywhere fertile, is overspread with a multitudinous
variety of nopal, maguey, and forests of evergreen,
among which the graceful fir and umbrageous oak
stand conspicuous. Seasons come and go and leave no
mark behind; or it may be said that spring, satisfied
with its abode, there takes up its perpetual rest; the
temperature is ever mellow, with resplendent sunshine
by day, while at night the stars shine with a brilliancy
nowhere excelled. The limits of the tierra templada
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
it is impossible to define, as the term is used in a somewhat
arbitrary manner by the inhabitants of different
altitudes. On the lowlands along the coast known as
the tierra caliente, the features of nature are changed;
vegetation assumes a more luxuriant aspect; palms, parasitical
plants and trees of a tropical character, take the
place of the evergreens of a colder clime; the climate
is not salubrious, and the heat is oppressive. On the
Atlantic side furious storms, called 'northers,' spring
up with a suddenness and violence unexampled in other
places, often causing much destruction to both life and
property.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TRIBES OF CENTRAL MEXICO.</p>

<p>For the purpose of description, I separate the Wild
Tribes of Mexico in two parts,&mdash;the <i>Wild Tribes of Central
Mexico</i>, and the <i>Wild Tribes of Southern Mexico</i>. The
first of these divisions extends from 23° north latitude
to the northern boundary of the state of Oajaca, or rather
to an imaginary line, taking as its base said boundary
and running from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico,
that is to say from Vera Cruz to Acapulco.</p>

<p>To enumerate and locate all the nations and tribes
within this territory, to separate the uncivilized from
the civilized, the mythical from the real, is not possible.
I have therefore deferred to the end of this
chapter such authorities as I have on the subject,
where they will be found ranged in proper order
under the head of <a href="#TRIBAL_VI">Tribal Boundaries</a>. Of the tribes that
are known to have possessed no civilization, such as was
found among the Aztecs and other cultivated nations, I
will only mention the people denominated <i>Chichimecs</i>,
under which general name were designated a multitude
of tribes inhabiting the mountains north of the valley
of Mexico, all of which were prominently dependent
on the result of the chase for their subsistence; the
ancient <i>Otomís</i> who mostly occupied the mountains
which inclose the valley of Mexico; and the <i>Pames</i> in
Querétaro. South of Mexico were numerous other
nations who were more or less intermixed with those
more civilized. Finally, I shall describe those people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
who, since they came in contact with the whites, have
retrograded in such a degree, that their manners and customs
can only be given in connection with those of the
Wild Tribes, and which comprise a large proportion of
all the present aborigines of Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL FEATURES IN NORTHERN MEXICO.</p>

<p>The natives of the valley of Mexico are represented
by some authorities as tall, by others as of short stature;
but from what I gather we may conclude that on the
whole they are over rather than under the middle height,
well made and robust. In Vera Cruz they are somewhat
shorter, say from four feet six inches to five feet
at most, and clumsily made, having their knees further
apart than Europeans and walking with their toes turned
in; the women are shorter than the men and become
fully developed at a very early age. In Jalisco both
sexes are tall; they are also well built, and among the
women are found many forms of such perfection that
they might well serve as models for sculpture. Throughout
the table-lands, the men are muscular and well proportioned.
Their skin is very thick and conceals the
action of the muscles; they are out-kneed, turn their
toes well in, and their carriage is anything but graceful.<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
Various opinions have been advanced by competent persons
in regard to the features of the natives of Mexico.
Baron Von Humboldt describes them as resembling the
aborigines of Canada, Peru, Florida, and Brazil; having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
elongated eyes, the corners turned towards the
temples, prominent cheek-bones, large lips, and a sweet
expression about the mouth, forming a strong contrast
with their otherwise gloomy and severe aspect. Rossi
says that their eyes are oval, and that their physiognomy
resembles that of the Asiatics. According to Prescott,
they bear a strong resemblance to the Egyptians, and
Viollet le Duc asserts that the Malay type predominates.
They have generally a very narrow forehead, an oval
face, long black eyes set wide apart, large mouth with
thick lips, teeth white and regular, the nose small and
rather flat. The general expression of the countenance
is melancholy, and exhibits a strange combination of
moroseness and gentleness. Although some very handsome
women are to be found among them, the majority
of the race, both men and women, are ugly, and in old
age, which with the women begins early, their faces are
much wrinkled and their features quite harsh. They have
acute senses, especially that of sight, which remains unimpaired
to a very advanced age. Long, straight, black,
thick, and glossy hair is common to all; their beard is thin,
and most of them, especially in the capital and its vicinity,
have a small moustache; but very few, if any, have hair
on their legs, thighs, or arms. It is very seldom that a
gray-haired native is found. All the people referred to,
are remarkable for their strength and endurance, which
may be judged of by the heavy burdens they carry on
their backs. The inhabitants of the table-lands are of
various hues; some are olive, some brown, others of a
red copper color. In the Sierras some have a bluish
tint as if dyed with indigo. The natives of the tierras
calientes are of a darker complexion, inclining to black.
There are some called <i>Indios Pintos</i>, whose cuticle is of
a less deep color, inclining more to yellowish and marked
with dark copper-colored spots.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEXICAN COSTUMES.</p>

<p>In the valley of Mexico the natives wear the <i>ichapilli</i>,
or a sort of shirt without sleeves, made of white and blue
striped cotton, which reaches to the knees and is gathered
round the waist with a belt. This is frequently the only
garment worn by the aborigines of the Mexican valley.
In lieu of the ancient feather ornaments for the head,
they now use large felt or straw hats, the rim of which
is about nine inches in width; or they bind round the
head a colored handkerchief. Most of the men and
women go barefooted, and those who have coverings for
their feet, use the <i>cacles</i>, or <i>huaraches</i>, (sandals) made of
tanned leather and tied with thongs to the ankles. The
dress of the women has undergone even less change than
that of the men, since the time of the Spanish conquest.
Many of them wear over the ichapilli a cotton or woolen
cloth, bound by a belt just above the hips; this answers
the purpose of a petticoat; it is woven in stripes of dark
colors or embellished with figures. The ichapilli is
white, with figures worked on the breast, and is longer
than that worn by the men. In Puebla the women
<span class="sidenote">DRESS IN MICHOACAN.</span>
wear very narrow petticoats and elegant <i>quichemels</i> covering
the breast and back and embroidered all over with
silk and worsted. In the state of Vera Cruz and other
parts of the tierra caliente the men's apparel consists of a
short white cotton jacket or a dark-colored woolen tunic,
with broad open sleeves fastened round the waist with a
sash, and short blue or white breeches open at the sides
near the knee; these are a Spanish innovation, but they
continue to wear the square short cloak, <i>tilma</i> or <i>tilmatli</i>,
with the end tied on one of the shoulders or across the
breast. Sometimes a pair of shorter breeches made of
goat or deer skin are worn over the cotton ones, and
also a jacket of the same material. The women wear a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span>
coarse cotton shift with large open sleeves, often worked
about the neck in bright colored worsted, to suit the
wearer's fancy; a blue woolen petticoat is gathered round
the waist, very full below, and a blue or brown rebozo
is used as a wrapper for the shoulders. Sometimes a
muffler is used for the head and face.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> They bestow
great care on their luxuriant hair, which they arrange
in two long braids that fall from the back of the head,
neatly painted and interwoven with worsted of lively
colors, and the ends tied at the waist-band or joined behind;
others bind the braids tightly round the head,
and occasionally add some wild flowers.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> In the tierra
fria, a thick dark woolen blanket with a hole in the
centre through which passes the head protects the wearer
during the day from the cold and rain, and serves at
night for a covering and often for the bed itself. This
garment has in some places taken the place of the tilmatli.
Children are kept in a nude state until they are
eight or ten years old, and infants are enveloped in a coarse
cotton cloth, leaving the head and limbs exposed. The
Huicholas of Jalisco have a peculiar dress; the men wear a
short tunic made of coarse brown or blue woolen fabric,
tightened at the waist with a girdle hanging down in
front and behind, and very short breeches of poorly
dressed goat or deer skin without hair, at the lower edges
of which are strung a number of leathern thongs. Married
men and women wear straw hats with high pointed
crowns and broad turned-up rims; near the top is a narrow
and handsomely woven band of many colors, with
long tassels. Their long bushy hair is secured tightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
round the crown of the head with a bright woolen ribbon.
Many of the men do up the hair in queues with
worsted ribbons, with heavy tassels that hang below the
waist.<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> De Laet, describing the natives of Jalisco early
in the seventeenth century, speaks of square cloths made
of cotton and maguey tied on the right or left shoulder,
and small pebbles or shells strung together as necklaces.
Mota Padilla, in his history of New Galicia, says that
the Chichimecs at Xalostitlan, in 1530, went naked.
The inhabitants of Alzatlan about that time adorned
themselves with feathers. In Zacualco, the common
dress of the women about the same period, particularly
widows, was the <i>huipil</i>, made of fine cotton cloth, generally
black. The natives of the province of Pánuco,
for many years after the Spanish Conquest, continued
to go naked; they pulled out the beard, perforated the
nose and ears, and, filing their teeth to a sharp point,
bored holes in them and dyed them black. The slayer
of a human being used to hang a piece of the skin and
hair of the slain at the waist, considering such things as
very valuable ornaments. Their hair they dyed in
various colors, and wore it in different forms. Their
women adorned themselves profusely, and braided their
hair with feathers. Sahagun, speaking of the Matlaltzincas,
says that their apparel was of cloth made from
the maguey; referring to the Tlahuicas, he mentions
among their faults that they used to go overdressed;
and of the Macoaques, he writes: that the oldest women
as well as the young ones paint themselves with a varnish
called <i>tecocavitl</i>, or with some colored stuff, and wear
feathers about their arms and legs. The Tlascaltecs
in 1568 wore cotton-cloth mantles painted in various
fine colors. The inhabitants of Cholula, according to
Cortés, dressed better than the Tlascaltecs; the better
class wearing over their other clothes a garment resembling
the Moorish cloak, yet somewhat different,
as that of Cholula had pockets, but in the cloth, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
cut, and the fringe, there was much resemblance to the
cloak worn in Africa. Old Spanish writers tell us that
the natives of Michoacan made much use of feathers for
wearing-apparel and for adorning their bodies and
heads. At their later religious festivals, both sexes
appear in white, the men with shirt and trowsers, having
a band placed slantingly across the breast and back, tied
to a belt round the waist, and on the head a small red
cloth arranged like a turban, from which are pendent
scarlet feathers, similar to those used by the ancient Aztec
warriors. The man is also adorned with a quantity of
showy beads, and three small mirrors, one of which is
placed on his breast, another on his back, and the third
invariably on his forehead. At his back he carries a
quiver, and in his hand a bow, adorned with bright colored
artificial flowers, or it may be the Aztec axe, so
painted and varnished as to resemble flint. At the
present time, a native woman, however poor, still wears
a necklace of coral or rows of red beads. The unmarried
women of Chilpanzinco used to daub their faces
with a pounded yellow flower. In Durango, the natives
were accustomed to rub their swarthy bodies with

<p>The dwellings of the Wild Tribes of Central Mexico
vary with climate and locality. In the lowlands, sheds
consisting of a few poles stuck in the ground, the spaces
between filled with rushes, and the roof covered with
palm-leaves, afforded sufficient shelter. In the colder
highlands they built somewhat more substantial houses
of trunks of trees, tied together with creeping plants,
the walls plastered with mud or clay, the roof of split
boards kept in place with stones. In treeless parts,
houses were constructed of adobe or sun-dried bricks and
stones, and the interior walls covered with mats; the
best houses were only one story high, and the humbler
habitations too low to allow a man to stand erect. The
entire house constituted but one room, where all the
family lived, sleeping on the bare ground. A few stones
placed in the middle of the floor, served as a fireplace
where food was cooked. In Vera Cruz there is a separate
small hut for cooking purposes. The wild nomadic
Chichimecs lived in caverns or fissures of rocks situated
in secluded valleys, and the Pames contented themselves
with the shade afforded by the forest-trees.<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.</p>

<p>Corn, beans, tomatoes, chile, and a variety of fruits
and vegetables constitute the chief subsistence of the
people, and in those districts where the banana flourishes,
it ranks as an important article of food. The
natives of Vera Cruz and Tamaulipas gather large quantities
of the pitahaya, by means of an osier basket
attached to a long pole; round the brim are arranged
several forks, for the purpose of detaching the fruit,
which then drops into the basket. From the blossoms
and buds they make a ragout, and also grind the seeds
for bread. From the sea and rivers they obtain a plentiful
supply of fish, and they have acquired from childhood
a peculiar habit of eating earth, which is said to
be injurious to their physical development. It has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
stated that in former days they used human flesh as food.</p>

<p>The Otomís and tribes of Jalisco cultivated but little
grain, and consumed that little before it ripened, trusting
for a further supply of food to the natural productions
of the soil and to game, such as rabbits, deer,
moles, and birds, and also foxes, rats, snakes and other
reptiles. Corn-cobs they ground, mixed cacao with the
powder, and baked the mixture on the fire. From the
lakes in the valley of Mexico they gathered flies' eggs,
deposited there in large quantities by a species of flies
called by the Mexicans <i>axayacatl</i>, that is to say, 'water-face,'
and by MM. Meneville and Virlet d'Aoust <i>corixa
femorata</i> and <i>notonecta unifasciata</i>. The eggs being
pounded, were moulded into lumps and sold in the
market-place; they were esteemed a special delicacy,
and were eaten fried. These people are also accused by
some authors of having eaten human flesh.<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

<p>Other tribes, inhabiting the valley of Mexico, Puebla,
Michoacan, and Querétaro, show a greater inclination to
cultivate the soil, and live almost wholly on the products
of their own industry. They plant corn by making a
hole in the ground with a sharp-pointed stick, into
which the seed is dropped and covered up. Honey is
plentiful, and when a tree is found where bees are at
work, they stop the entrance with clay, cut off the
branch and hang it outside their huts; after a short
time they remove the clay, and the bees continue their
operations in their new locality, as if they had not been
disturbed.<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Gemelli Careri thus describes a novel method of
catching ducks: "Others contrive to deceive ducks, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
shy as they are; for when they have us'd 'em to be frequently
among calabashes left floating on the lake for
that purpose, they make holes in those calabashes, so
that putting their heads in them, they can see out of
them, and then going up to the neck in the water, they
go among the ducks and draw 'em down by the feet."
For making tortillas, the corn is prepared by placing it
in water, to which a little lime is added, and allowing it
to soak all night, or it is put to simmer over a slow fire;
the husk is then easily separated and the corn mashed
or ground on the metate. From this paste the tortilla
is formed by patting it between the hands into a
very thin cake, which is cooked on an earthern pan
placed over the fire; the tortilla is eaten with boiled
beans, and a mixture of chile and lard. The ground
corn is also mixed with water and strained through a
sieve; of this liquor they make a gruel, to which is
added a little cacao or sugar. The sediment which remains
in the sieve is used to make tamales, which are
a combination of chopped meat, chile, and onions, which
ingredients are covered with the corn paste, and the
whole enveloped in corn or plantain leaves and boiled or
baked. The Mexicans are very moderate eaters, but
have an insatiable passion for strong liquors.<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>Laziness and filth follow us as we proceed southward
in our observations; among the Mexicans, the poorer
classes especially are filthy in their persons, and have a
disgusting appearance, which increases with the infirmities
of age. Many of them indulge freely in the use
of a steam-bath called <i>temazcalli</i>, similar to the Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
vapor-bath, but it does not appear to have the effect of
cleansing their persons.<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS AND SHIELDS.</p>

<p>All these tribes use bows and arrows; the latter carried
in a quiver slung at the back, a few spare ones
being stuck in the belt for immediate use. A heavy
club is secured to the arm by a thong, and wielded with
terrible effect at close quarters. In battle, the principal
warriors are armed with spears and shields. Another
weapon much in use is the sling, from which they cast
stones to a great distance and with considerable accuracy.
The natives of the valley of Mexico kill birds
with small pellets blown through a hollow tube.<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>The clubs, which are from three to four feet in length,
are made of a species of heavy wood, some having a
round knob at the end similar to a mace, others broad
and flat, and armed with sharp pieces of obsidian, fastened
on either side. Acosta states that with these
weapons they could cut off the head of a horse at one
stroke. Spears and arrows are pointed with flint or
obsidian, the latter having a reed shaft with a piece of
hard wood inserted into it to hold the point. Their
quivers are made of deer-skin, and sometimes of seal
or shark-skin. Shields are ingeniously constructed of
small canes so woven together with thread that they
can be folded up and carried tied under the arm. When
wanted for use they are loosed, and when opened out
they cover the greater part of the body.<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR AND TREATMENT OF CAPTIVES.</p>

<p>Aboriginally, as with most northern nations, warfare
was the normal state of these people. The so-called
Chichimecs attacked all who entered their domain,
whether for hunting, collecting fruit, or fighting. War
once declared between two tribes, each side endeavors
to secure by alliance as many of their neighbors as
possible; to which end ambassadors are despatched to
the chiefs of adjacent provinces, each bearing in his
hand an arrow of the make peculiar to the tribe of
the stranger chief. Arriving at the village, the messenger
seeks out the chief and lays the arrow at his
feet; if the proposal of his master be accepted by the
stranger chief, the rendezvous is named and the messenger
departs. The ambassadors having returned with
their report, preparations are at once made for the reception
of the allies, a feast is prepared, large quantities
of game and intoxicating drink are made ready,
and as soon as the guests arrive the viands are placed
before them. Then follow eating and drinking, concluding
with drunken orgies; this finished, a council
is held, and the assault planned, care being taken to
secure places suitable for an ambuscade and stones for
the slingers. A regular organization of forces is observed
and every effort made to outflank or surround
the enemy. Archers and slingers march to an attack
in single file, always occupying the van, while warriors
armed with clubs and lances are drawn up in the rear;
the assault is commenced by the former, accompanied
with furious shouts and yells. During the period of
their wars against the Spaniards, they often expended
much time and labor in the fortification of heights by
means of tree-trunks, and large rocks, which were so
arranged, one on top of another, that at a given signal
they might be loosened, and let fall on their assailants.
The chiefs of the Tepecanos and contiguous tribes
carried no weapons during the action, but had rods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
with which they chastised those who exhibited symptoms
of cowardice, or became disorderly in the ranks.<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>
The slain were scalped or their heads cut off, and
prisoners were treated with the utmost barbarity, ending
invariably in the death of the unfortunates; often
were they scalped while yet alive, and the bloody trophy
placed upon the heads of their tormentors. The
heads of the slain were placed on poles and paraded
through their villages in token of victory, the inhabitants
meanwhile dancing round them. Young children
were sometimes spared, and reared to fight in the ranks
of their conquerors; and in order to brutalize their
youthful minds and eradicate all feelings of affection
toward their own kindred, the youthful captives were
given to drink the brains and blood of their murdered
parents. The Chichimecs carried with them a bone,
on which, when they killed an enemy, they marked a
notch, as a record of the number each had slain. Mota
Padilla states that when Nuño de Guzman arrived in
the valley of Coynan, in Jalisco, the chiefs came out to
meet him, and, as a sign of peace and obedience, dropped
on one knee; upon being raised up by the Spaniards,
they placed round their necks strings of rabbits and
quails, in token of respect.<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>As the wants of the people are few and simple, so is
the inventory of their implements and household furniture.
Every family is supplied with the indispensable
metate, an oblong stone, about twelve by eighteen inches,
smooth on the surface and resting upon three legs in a
slanting position; with this is used a long stone roller,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
called the <i>metlapilli</i>, for rubbing down the maize, and a
large earthen pan, called the <i>comalli</i>, on which to bake the
tortillas. Their bottles, bowls, and cups are made from
gourds, often prettily painted, and kept hanging round
the walls; some unglazed earthenware vessels, ornamented
with black figures on a dull red ground, are used
for cooking, a block of wood serves for a stool and
table, and lastly a few petates (Aztec, <i>petlatl</i>, 'palm-leaf
mat'), are laid upon the ground for beds. These comprise
the whole effects of a native's house. For agricultural
purposes, they have wooden spades, hoes, and sharp
stakes for planting corn. Their products are carried
home or to market in large wicker-work frames, often
five feet high by two and a half feet broad, made from
split palm-leaves.<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>In the State of Jalisco, the natives are celebrated for
the manufacture of blankets and woolen mantas; in
other parts of the country they continue to weave cotton
stuffs in the same manner as before the conquest, all
on very primitive hand-looms. The common designs
are in blue or red and white stripes, but they are sometimes
neatly worked with figures, the juice from the
murex or purple shell supplying the vermilion color for
the patterns. The inhabitants of Tonala exhibit much
taste and excellence in the production of pottery, making
a great variety of toys, masks, figures, and ornaments,
besides the vessels for household use. In the
vicinity of Santa Cruz, the fibres of the aloe, crushed
upon the metate, are employed for the manufacture of
ropes, nets, bags, and flat round pelotas, used in rubbing
down the body after a bath. Palm-leaf mats and
dressed skins also figure largely among the articles of
native industry.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span></p>

<p>In Vera Cruz, they have canoes dug out of the trunk
of a mahogany or cedar tree, which are capable of holding
several persons, and are worked with single paddles.<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRADE AND ARTS.</p>

<p>A considerable trade is carried on in pottery, mats,
dressed skins, and manufactures of the aloe-fibre; also
fruit, feathers, vegetables, and fish. All such wares are
packed in light osier baskets, which, thrown upon their
backs, are carried long distances to the several markets.
In the province of Vera Cruz, vanilla, jalap, and other
herbs are important articles of native commerce, and all
the interior tribes place a high value on salt, for which
they readily exchange their products.<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>The natives display much patience and skill in ornamental
work, especially carvings in stone, and in painting;
although the figures, their gods bearing witness,
are all of grotesque shapes and appearance. With nothing
more than a rude knife, they make very ingenious
figures, of wax, of the pith of trees, of wood, charcoal,
clay, and bone. They are fond of music, and readily
imitate any strain they hear. From time immemorial
they have retained a passion for flowers, in all seasons
of the year tastefully decorating therewith their dwellings
and shops. The art of working in gold and silver
is well known to the natives of Jalisco, who execute
well-shaped specimens of cups and vases, beautifully
engraved and ornamented.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a></span></p>

<p>The wild tribes surrounding, and in places intermixed
with, the Civilized Nations of Central Mexico, as far as
I can learn, do not appear to have had any systematic
tribal government; at least, none of the old historians
have given any account of such. Some of the tribes
attach themselves to chiefs of their own choice, to whom
they pay a certain tribute from the produce of their
labor or hunting expeditions, while others live without
any government or laws whatsoever, and only elect a
chief on going to war.<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MARRIAGE CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>Marriage takes place at an early age, and girls are
seldom found single after they attain fourteen or fifteen
years. Gomara, however, says that women in the district
of Tamaulipas are not married till they reach the
age of forty. The Otomís marry young, and if, when
arrived at the age of puberty, a young girl has not
found a mate, her parents or guardians select one for her,
so that none shall remain single. Among the Guachichiles,
when a young man has selected a girl, he takes her on
trial for an indefinite period; if, afterwards, both parties
are satisfied with each other, the ceremony of marriage
is performed; should it happen, however, that the man
be not pleased, he returns the girl to her parents, which
proceeding does not place any obstacle in the way of her
obtaining another suitor. The Chichimecs cannot marry
without the consent of parents; if a young man violates
this law and takes a girl without first obtaining the
parental sanction, even with the intention of marrying
her, the penalty is death; usually, in ancient
times, the offender was shot with arrows. When one of
this people marries, if the girl proves not to be a virgin,
the marriage is null, and the girl is returned to her
parents. When a young man desires to marry, his
parents make a visit to those of the intended bride, and
leave with them a bouquet of flowers bound with red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
wool; the bride's parents then send round to the houses
of their friends a bunch of mariguana, a narcotic herb,
which signifies that all are to meet together at the bride's
father's on the next night. The meeting is inaugurated
by smoking; then they chew mariguana, during which
time all preliminaries of the marriage are settled. The
following day the resolutions of the conclave are made
known to the young man and woman, and if the decision
is favorable, the latter sends her husband a few presents,
and from that time the parties consider themselves married,
and the friends give themselves up to feasting and
dancing.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<p>A plurality of wives was found among all the inhabitants
of this region at the time of the Spanish conquest,
the first wife taking precedence of those who came after
her. Many had concubines who, it may be said, ranked
third in the family circle. The missionary Fathers,
however, soon put an end to the custom of more than
one wife, whenever they had the power to do so. Herrera
says that the Chichimecs indulged in one wife only,
but that they had the habit of repudiating her for any
slight cause, and of taking another. The women are
kept under subjection by their husbands, and not only
have all the indoor work to do, such as cooking,
spinning, and mat-making, but they are also required to
carry heavy burdens home from the market, and bring
all the wood and water for household use. Infants are
carried on the mother's back, wrapped in a coarse cotton
cloth, leaving the head and legs free. Among the
Chichimecs, when a woman goes out of her house, she
places her child in a wicker basket, and there leaves it,
usually suspending it from the branch of a tree. A child
is suckled by the mother until another comes on and
crowds it out. Mühlenpfordt relates that he saw a boy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a></span>
seven or eight years of age demanding suck and receiving
it from his mother. A woman near her time of
confinement, retires to a dark corner of the house,
attended by some aged woman, who sings to her, and
pretends to call the baby from afar. This midwife, however,
does not in any way assist at the birth, but as
soon as the child is born she goes out, meanwhile covering
her face with her hands, so that she may not see.
Having walked once round the house, she opens her
eyes, and the name of the first object she sees is chosen
as the name of the child. Among the Otomís, a young
woman about to become a mother is the victim of much
unnecessary suffering arising from their superstitious
practices; loaded with certain amulets and charms, she
must carefully avoid meeting certain individuals and
animals whose look might produce evil effects&mdash;a black
dog especially must be avoided. The song of a mocking-bird
near the house is held to be a happy omen.
At certain hours the mother was to drink water
which had been collected in the mountains, and previously
presented to the gods; the phases of the moon
were carefully watched. She was obliged to undergo
an examination from the old crone who attended her,
and who performed certain ceremonies, such as burning
aromatic herbs mingled with saltpetre. Sometimes,
amidst her pains, the ancient attendant obliged her
charge to jump about, and take powerful medicines,
which frequently caused abortion or premature delivery.
If the child was a boy, one of the old men took it in
his arms and painted on its breast an axe or some implement
of husbandry, on its forehead a feather, and on
the shoulders a bow and quiver; he then invoked for it
the protection of the gods. If the child proved to be
a female, the same ceremony was observed, with the
exception that an old woman officiated, and the figure of
a flower was traced over the region of the heart, while
on the palm of the right hand a spinning-wheel was
pictured, and on the left a piece of wool, thus indicating
the several duties of after life. According to the <i>Apostólicos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
Afanes</i>, the Coras call the child after one of
its uncles or aunts. In twelve months' time a feast is
prepared in honor of said young, and the mother and
child, together with the uncle or aunt, placed in the
middle of the circle of relatives. Upon these occasions
much wine is drunk, and for the first time salt is placed
in the child's mouth. As soon as the child's teeth are
all cut, a similar meeting takes place, and the child is
then given its first meal; and again, at the age of
twelve, the ancients come together, when the youth is
first given wine to drink. As a rule, young people show
great respect and affection for their parents; all their
earnings being at once handed over to them.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>In early times, immorality and prostitution existed
among these nations to an unparalleled extent. Gomara
says that in the province of Tamaulipas there were public
brothels, where men enacted the part of women, and
where every night were assembled as many as a thousand,
more or less, of these worse than beastly beings,
according to the size of the village. It is certain that
incest and every species of fornication was commonly
practiced, especially in the districts of Vera Cruz, Tamaulipas,
and Querétaro.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHILDREN AND AMUSEMENTS.</p>

<p>Their amusements are stamped with the general melancholy
of their character. Dancing, accompanied with
music and singing, is their favorite pastime, but it is
seldom indulged in without the accompanying vice of
intoxication. When the Totonacs join in their national
dances, they attach a kind of rattle called <i>aiacachtli</i>
to a band round the head, that produces a
peculiar sound during the performance. Among some
tribes women are not permitted to join in the dances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
They make various kinds of drinks and intoxicating
liquors. One is made from the fruit of the nopal or
prickly pear, which is first peeled and pressed; the juice
is then passed through straw sieves, and placed by a fire
or in the sun, where in about an hour it ferments.
Another drink, called chicha, is made from raw sugar-cane,
which is mashed with a wooden mallet and passed
through a pressing-machine. Their principal and national
drink is pulque, made from the agave americana,
and is thus prepared: When the plant is about to bloom,
the heart or stalk is cut out, leaving a hole in the center,
which is covered with the outer leaves. Every twenty-four
hours, or in the hotter climates twice a day, the
cavity fills with the sap from the plant, which is taken
out and fermented by the addition of some already-fermented
pulque, and the process is continued until the
plant ceases to yield a further supply. The liquor
obtained is at first of a thick white color, and is at
all times very intoxicating.<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MAKING AN ALLIANCE.</p>

<p>Father Joseph Arlegui, in his <i>Chrónica de la Provincia
de Zacatecas</i>, which province then comprised a
much larger extent of territory than the present state
of Zacatecas, describes a singular ceremony nowhere
else mentioned. It is employed when one nation
wishes to form a close connection, friendship, alliance,
family or blood relationship, so to say (tratan de hacerse
parientes), with another nation; and the process
is as follows: From the tribe with which the alliance
is desired, a man is seized, and a feast or drunken
carousal commenced. Meanwhile the victim destined
to form the connecting link between the two bands,
and whose blood is to cement their friendship, is kept
without food for twenty-four hours. Into him is then
poured of their execrable beverages until he is filled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
and his senses are deadened, when he is stretched
before a fire, built in a wide open place, where all
the people may have access to him. Having warmed
well his body, and rubbed his ears, each aspirant to the
new friendship, armed with a sharp awl-shaped instrument,
made of deer's bone, proceeds to pierce the ears of
the prostrate wretch, each in turn forcing his sharpened
bone through some new place, which causes the
blood to spurt afresh with every incision. With the
blood so drawn, the several members of the tribe anoint
themselves, and the ceremony is done. On the spot
where the relative of a Cora is killed in a fight, a
piece of cloth is dipped in blood, and kept as a remembrance,
until his death be avenged by killing the slayer,
or one of the males of his family. When meeting each
other on a journey, they make use of many complimentary
salutations, and a kind of freemasonry appears
to exist among them. Major Brantz Mayer mentions a
tribe at Cuernavaca that, in the event of a white man
arriving at their village, immediately seize and place
him under guard for the night in a large hut; he and
his animals are carefully provided for until the following
day, when he is despatched from the village under an
escort, to wait upon him until far beyond the limits of
the settlement. The custom, at the present day, of hiding
money in the ground is universal; nothing would
induce a native to entrust his savings with another. The
inhabitants of Querétaro spend much of their time basking
in the sun, and if the sun does not yield sufficient
warmth, they scoop out a hole in the ground, burn in it
branches and leaves of the maguey, and when properly
heated, lay themselves down in the place, and cover
themselves with a mat or the loose earth.<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span></p>

<p>The Mexicans are not subject to many diseases. Small-pox,
brought into the country at the time of the conquest,
typhoid fever, and syphilis are those which
cause the greatest destruction of life; the two former
are aggravated by the filthy condition of the villages.
Yellow fever, or black vomit, very rarely attacks the
aborigines. The measles is a prevalent disease. Death
is likewise the result of severe wounds, fractures, or
bruises, most of which end in mortification, owing to
neglect, or to the barbarous remedies applied to combat
them. The Huastecs of Vera Cruz suffer from certain
worms that breed in their lips, and highly esteem salt
for the curative properties they believe it to possess
against this disorder. At the village of Comalá, in the
state of Colima, a considerable number of the children
are born deaf and dumb, idiots, or deformed; besides
which, when they reach a mature age, if we may believe
the early chroniclers, the goitres are more or less developed
on them, notwithstanding Humboldt's assertion
that the aborigines never suffer from this disorder.
There is another disease, cutaneous in its character,
which is quite prevalent in many parts of the country,
and is supposed to be contracted under the influence
of a warm, humid, and unhealthy climate, and may
be described as follows: Without pain the skin assumes
a variety of colors, the spots produced being white, red,
brownish, or blue. The Pintos, as south-western coast-dwellers
are called, the chief victims to this disorder,
experience no physical pain, except when they go into
a cold climate; then they feel twitchings in the places
where the skin has changed color. The disease is declared
to be contagious: and from all accounts no remedy
for it has been as yet discovered. Formerly, an epidemic
called the <i>matlalzahuatl</i> visited the country at long intervals
and caused terrible havoc. All the Spanish writers
who speak of it call it the <i>peste</i>, and suppose it to be the
same scourge that destroyed nearly the whole population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span>
of the Toltec empire in the eleventh century. Others
believe it to have borne a greater similarity to yellow
fever. The disease, whatever it is, made its appearance
in 1545, 1576, and 1736, since which date I find no
mention of it, destroying each time an immense number
of people; but upon no occasion did it attack the
pure whites or the mestizos. Its greatest havoc was in
the interior, on the central plateau, and in the coldest
and most arid regions, the lowlands of the coast being
nearly, if not entirely, free from its effects.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>

<p>When small-pox was first introduced, the natives
resorted to bathing as a cure, and a very large number
succumbed to the disease. An old Spanish author,
writing in 1580, states that the natives of the kingdom
of New Spain had an extensive knowledge of medicinal
herbs; that they seldom resorted to bleeding or compound
purgatives, for they had many simple cathartic
herbs. They were in the habit of making pills with
the India-rubber gum mixed with other substances,
which they swallowed, and rubbed themselves withal,
to increase their agility and suppleness of body. Cold
water baths are commonly resorted to when attacked
with fever, and they cannot be prevailed upon to abandon
the practice. The <i>temazcalli</i> or sweat-bath, is also
very much used for cases of severe illness. The bath-house
stands close to a spring of fresh water, and is
built and heated not unlike a European bake-oven.
When up to the required temperature the fire is taken
out, and water thrown in; the patient is then thrust into
it naked, feet foremost and head near the aperture, and
laid on a mat that covers the hot stones. The hole that
affords him air for breathing is about eighteen inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a></span>
square. When sufficiently steamed, and the body well
beaten with rushes, a cold water bath and a brisk rubbing
complete the operation.<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p>In Michoacan, the natives believe that the leaves of
a plant called <i>cozolmecatl</i> or <i>olcacaran</i> applied to a sore
part of the body will foretell the result of the disorder;
for if the leaves adhere to the spot, it is a sure sign that
the sufferer will get well, but if they fall off, the contrary
will happen. When prostrated with disease, the
nearest relatives and friends surround the patient's
couch and hold a confab upon the nature of his ailment
and the application of the remedy. Old sorceresses and
charlatans put in practice their spells; fumigations and
meltings of saltpetre abound; and by some jugglery, out
of the crystallized saltpetre is brought a monstrous ant,
a horrible worm, or some other object, which, as they
allege, is the cause of the disorder. As the disease progresses,
the friends of the sufferer severally recommend
and apply, according to the judgment each may have
formed of the matter, oil of scorpions or of worms,
water supposed to produce miraculous effects on fevers,
or like applications, and these empirical remedies, most
of which are entirely useless, and others extremely barbarous,
are applied together without weight or measure.<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BURIAL AND CHARACTER.</p>

<p>In common with other peoples, it is usual with these
nations to place several kinds of edibles in the grave
with the deceased. Among the Coras, when one died,
the corpse was dressed and wrapped in a mantle; if a
man, with bow and arrows, and if a woman, with her
distaff, etc., and in this manner the body was buried
in a cave previously selected by the deceased. All
his worldly goods were placed at the door of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a></span>
former house, so that he might come and take them
without crossing the threshold, as they believed the dead
returned to see about property. If the deceased had
cattle, his friends and relatives every now and then
placed some meat upon sticks about the fields, for fear
he might come for the cattle he formerly owned. Five
days after death a hired wizard essayed to conjure away
the shade of the departed property-holder. These
spirit-scarers went smoking their pipes all over the dead
man's house, and shook zapote-branches in the corners,
till they pretended to have found the fancied shadow,
which they hurled headlong to its final resting-place.
Upon the second of November most of the natives of
the Mexican valley bring offerings to their dead relatives
and friends, consisting of edibles, live animals,
and flowers, which are laid on or about the graves.
The anniversary or commemoration of the dead among
the ancient Aztecs occurred almost upon the same day.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>The thick-skinned, thoughtful and reserved aboriginals
of central Mexico are most enigmatical in their
character. Their peculiar cast of features, their natural
reserve, and the thickness of their skin, make it extremely
difficult to ascertain by the expression of the
face what their real thoughts are. The general characteristics
of this people may be summed up as follows:
peaceable, gentle and submissive to their superiors,
grave even to melancholy, and yet fond of striking
exhibitions and noisy revelry; improvident but charitable,
sincerely pious, but wallowing in ignorance and
superstitions; quick of perception, and possessed of great
facility for acquiring knowledge, especially of the arts,
very imitative, but with little originality, unambitious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
unwilling to learn, and indifferent to the comforts of
life. Irascibility is by no means foreign to their nature,
but it seems to lie dormant until awakened by intoxication
or some powerful impulse, when the innate
cruelty flames forth, and they pass suddenly from a
state of perfect calmness to one of unrestrained fierceness.
Courage and cowardice are so blended in their
character that it is no easy matter to determine which
is the predominant trait. A fact worthy of notice is
that upon many occasions they have proved themselves
capable of facing danger with the greatest resolution,
and yet they will tremble at the angry frown of a
white man. Laziness, and a marked inclination to
cheating and stealing are among the other bad qualities
attributed to them; but there is abundant evidence to
show, that although naturally averse to industry, they
work hard from morning till night, in mining, agriculture,
and other occupations, and in their inefficient
way accomplish no little labor. Murder and highway
robbery are crimes not generally committed by the
pure aboriginal, who steals rarely anything but food
to appease his hunger or that of his family. A Mexican
author says, the Indian cuts down a tree to pick
its fruit, destroys an oak of ten years growth for a
week's firewood; in other words, he produces little, consumes
little, and destroys much. Another Mexican
writer affirms that the Indian is active, industrious,
handy in agricultural labor, a diligent servant, a trusty
postman, humble, hospitable to his guests, and shows
a sincere gratitude to his benefactors.<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER IN NORTHERN MEXICO.</p>

<p>The Pames, Otomís, Pintos, and other nations north
of the Mexican valley were, at the time of the conquest,
a barbarous people, fierce and warlike, covetous even of
trifles and fond of display. The Michoacaques or Tarascos
are warlike and brave, and for many years after the
conquest showed themselves exceedingly hostile to the
whites, whom they attacked, plundered, and frequently
murdered, when traveling through their country. In
1751 they were already quiet, and gave evidences of
being intelligent and devoted to work. The men in the
vicinity of the city of Vera Cruz are careless, lazy, and
fickle; much given to gambling and drunkenness; but
the women are virtuous, frugal, cleanly, and extremely
industrious. The natives of Jalapa, judging by their
countenance, are less intelligent, and lack the sweetness
of character that distinguishes the inhabitants of the
higher plateau; they are, however, peaceable and inoffensive.
The wild tribes of the north are rude, revengeful,
dull, irreligious, lazy, and given to robbery, plunder,
and murder. Such are the characteristics attributed to
them under the name of Chichimecs by old Spanish authors
and others. Indeed, the only creditable traits they
were allowed to possess, were, in certain parts, courage
and an independent spirit. Of the nations of Jalisco,
both ancient and modern writers bear testimony to their
bravery. They are also sagacious and somewhat industrious,
but opposed to hard labor (as what savage is not),
and not easily kept under restraint. Those who dwell
on Lake Chapala are quiet and mild, devoted to agricultural
pursuits. They indeed proved themselves high-spirited
and efficient in defending their rights, when
long oppression had exhausted their forbearance. The
Coras were hardy and warlike, averse to any intercourse
with the whites and to the Christian religion,
but by the efforts of the missionaries, and the heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
blows of the Spanish soldiers, they were brought under
subjection, and became tractable.<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE NATIONS OF SOUTHERN MEXICO.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Southern Mexicans</span>, under which name I group
the people inhabiting the present states of Oajaca, Guerrero,
Chiapas, the southern portion of Vera Cruz,
Tabasco, and Yucatan, constitute the second and last
division of this chapter. Much of this territory is situated
within the <i>tierras calientes</i>, or hot lands, wherein
every variety of tropical vegetation abounds in luxuriant
profusion. The heat, especially along the coast, to the
unacclimated is most oppressive. The great chain of
the cordillera in its transit across the Tehuantepec isthmus,
approaches nearer to the Pacific seaboard than to
the Atlantic, and dropping from the elevated table-land
of central Mexico, seeks a lower altitude, and breaks
into cross-ridges that traverse the country in an east and
west direction. Upon the northern side of the isthmus
are plains of considerable extent, of rich alluvial soil,
through which several rivers, after draining the mountain
districts, discharge into the Mexican gulf. These
streams, in their course through the table-lands, are bordered
by rich lands of greater or lesser extent. On the
southern side, nature puts on a bolder aspect and a narrower
belt of lowlands is traversed by several rivers,
which discharge the drainage of the southern slope into
the Pacific Ocean, and into the lagoons that border the
ocean. One of the most important features of Yucatan
is the absence of any important river. The coast, which
is of great extent, has in general a bleak and arid appearance,
and is little broken except on the north-west,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">645</a></span>
where it is indented by the laguna de Terminos, and
on the eastern side by the bays of Ascension, Espíritu
Santo, and Chetumel. The central part of the Yucatan
peninsula is occupied by a low ridge of mountains, of
barren aspect. A short distance from the coast the
general appearance of the country improves, being well-wooded,
and containing many fertile tracts.</p>

<p>Many of the nations occupying this region at the
time of the conquest may be called cultivated, or at
least, progressive, and consequently belong to the civilized
nations described in the second volume of this work;
others falling back into a state of wildness after the central
civilization was extinguished, makes it extremely
difficult to draw any line separating civilization from
savagism. Nevertheless we will examine them as best
we may; and if it be found that what we learn of them
refers more to the present time than has been the case
with nations hitherto treated, the cause will be obvious.</p>

<p>The <i>Zapotecs</i>, who were in former times a very powerful
nation, still occupy a great portion of Oajaca, surrounded
by the ruins of their ancient palaces and cities.
The whole western part of the state is taken up by the
<i>Miztecs</i>. Tributary to the above before the conquest,
were the <i>Mijes</i> and other smaller tribes now residing in
the mountain districts in the centre of the isthmus.
The <i>Huaves</i>, who are said to have come by sea from the
south, and to have landed near the present city of Tehuantepec,
spread out over the lowlands and around the
lagoons on the south-western coast of Oajaca. In the
province of Goazacoalco, and in Tabasco, are the <i>Ahualulcos</i>,
and <i>Chontales</i>, who occupy a large portion of the
latter state. South of them in Chiapas are the <i>Choles</i>,
<i>Tzendales</i>, <i>Zotziles</i>, <i>Alames</i>, and <i>Quelenes</i>, and in the extreme
south-eastern end of the same state, and extending
into Central America, some tribes of the <i>Lacandones</i>
are located. The extensive peninsula of Yucatan, the
ancient name of which was Mayapan, formed the independent
and powerful kingdom of the Mayas, who held
undisputed possession of the country until, after a heroic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
resistance, they were finally compelled to yield to the
superior discipline and weapons of the Spanish invaders.<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSIQUE IN OAJACA AND YUCATAN.</p>

<p>The Zapotecs proper are well-formed and strong; the
features of the men are of a peculiar cast and not pleasing;
the women, however, are delicately formed, and
graceful with handsome features. Another tribe of the
same nation, the Zapotecs of Tehuantepec, are rather under
the medium height, with a pleasing oval face and present
a fine personal appearance. Not a few of them
have light-colored hair, and a somewhat fair complexion.
Their senses, especially that of sight, are acute, and the
constitution sound and robust, notwithstanding their
habits of intoxication. The females have regular and
handsome features, and though of small stature and
bizarre in their carriage, are truly graceful and seductive.
Dark lustrous eyes, long eye-lashes, well defined
eye-brows, luxuriant and glossy jet-black hair, play
havoc with the men. Those of Acayucan village are
particularly noted for their beauty. But not all are
thus; instance the Chatinos who are remarkably ugly.
The natives of Oajaca are generally large and well-formed;
those of Sierra are of a light-yellow complexion, and
their women are tolerably white with mild features.
Some branches of the Miztecs and Mazatecs carry upon
their shoulders very large loads. Father Burgoa writing
of the Miztecs, of Yangüistlan, in the year 1541,
speaks of their beautiful complexion and fine forms.
The Mijes are of good height, strongly built, hardy, and
active; they wear a beard, and altogether their aspect is
repulsive. The Zoques are very much like the Mijes,
their features are as prominent and unprepossessing; but
they are probably more athletic. The Chontales are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
tall and very robust. In the village of Tequisistlan,
Oajaca, shortly after the Spanish conquest, they were
all reported as of a gigantic stature. The Huaves present
a different appearance from any of the other natives
of the isthmus of Tehuantepec. They are generally well-made,
and of strong constitutions. The natives of Tabasco
who dwell in the country bordering on the river of
that name, are of medium height, and with well-developed
limbs. Both men and women have round flat
faces, low foreheads, small eyes, flattish noses, thick lips,
small but quite full mouths, white teeth, and tawny
complexions. The Ahualulcos are rather under the
middle height, but of great physical strength. They
have a low narrow forehead, salient cheek-bones, full
lips, white teeth, small beard, and coarse hair. Their
features are aquiline, and the expression of their countenance
is melancholy, one of gentleness blended with
sternness. They strongly resemble the descendants of
the Aztecs of Mexico. The women are more delicately
made, and some beautiful ones are seen among them.
They move quickly and with much natural grace.<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>The descendants of the Mayas are of medium size,
with good limbs, large faces and mouth, the upper lip
slightly arched, and a marked tendency to stoutness;
the nose is somewhat flat, eyes sleepy-looking and hair
black and glossy, which rarely turns gray; complexion
of a copper color, and in some instances yellowish. Naturally
strong, the Maya or Yucatec can carry heavy
loads long distances, and perform a great deal of hard
labor without showing signs of fatigue. An old Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
writer mentions that they were generally bow-legged,
and many of them squint-eyed. The same author says
they had good faces, were not very dark, did not wear a
beard, and were long-lived. The women are plump, and
generally speaking not ugly.<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DRESS IN OAJACA AND YUCATAN.</p>

<p>Very scanty was the dress of the dwellers on Tehuantepec
isthmus. In Oajaca and Chiapas, the men wore
a piece of deer or other skin fastened round the waist,
and hanging down in front, and the women wore aprons
of maguey-fibre. Montanus in describing the Mijes says
they were quite naked, but that some wore round the
waist a white deer-skin dressed with human hearts. The
Lacandones, when going to war, wore on their shoulders
the skin of a tiger, lion, or deer. The Quelenes wrapped
round their head a colored cloth, in the manner of a
turban, or garland of flowers. At present, the usual
dress of the Zapotecs is a pair of wide Mexican drawers,
and short jacket of cotton, with a broad-brimmed hat,
made of felt or straw&mdash;yet the Huaves and many of the
poorer class, still wear nothing but a breech-cloth. The
costume of the women is simple, and not without elegance.
That of the Miztecs, Zapotecs, and others dwelling
in the city of Tehuantepec is a skirt made of cotton,&mdash;sometimes
of wool&mdash;that reaches nearly to the ankles,
prettily and often elaborately worked in various designs
and colors. The upper part of the body is covered
with a kind of chemisette, with short sleeves called the
<i>huipil</i>, of fine texture, and adorned with lace and gold
or silk threads. On the head is a white cotton covering,
made like a narrow sack or sleeve, which is drawn
on and hangs down over the back. In Tabasco, the
dress of the men differs little from that of the people
of Tehuantepec; the Tabascan women wear a cotton
petticoat or a few yards of calico wrapped round the
waist, and reaching below the knees. Over the petticoat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
they wear a frock with sleeves to the wrist, leaving
the bosom and neck exposed. Children and boys go
naked; indeed, whenever clothing to any extent is found
in this region, we may be sure that the foreign trader
is at the bottom of it.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>Both sexes usually wear the hair long, parting it in
the middle, and either permit it to hang in loose tresses
over the shoulders, or, binding it with gay colored ribbons,
loop it up on the back of the head, where it is
fastened with a large comb. On festive occasions they
interweave flowers with the hair, and also mingle with
it a species of shining beetle, called <i>cucullo</i>, which emits
a phosphorescent light, and produces a very pretty effect.
Among the Zoques who reside at San Miguel and Santa
María Chimalapa, the males shave the crown of the
head, a custom of possible monkish origin peculiar to
themselves. Feather tufts and skins of green birds
were formerly much used for ornaments; they had also
necklaces made of pieces of gold joined together, and
amber beads. Nose and ears were pierced, and pieces
of stone or amber or gold rings or a bit of carved wood
inserted. Montanus describes a kind of snake called
<i>ibobaca</i>, which he says the inhabitants of Chiapas wore
round the neck.<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> They also painted and stained the
face. When Fernandez de Córdova explored the northern
coast of Yucatan, he found the people clad in cotton
garments, and at the present day this forms the principal
material from which their clothing is made. Men
now wear a cotton shirt or blouse, usually without
sleeves, and wide drawers; round the waist is tied a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
white or colored sash; for protection from the sun, a
straw hat is worn, or perhaps a piece of colored calico,
and their sandals are made from deer-skin. Instead of
drawers, they used to wear a broad cotton band passed
round the loins, the ends of which were arranged to
hang one in front and the other behind; a cloak or mantle
of cotton called <i>zugen</i> was thrown over the shoulders.
Colonel Galindo mentions that they used the bark
of the India-rubber tree for making garments, and Cogolludo
says that when the Spaniards arrived at Aké, in
the year 1527, the army of natives were in a state of
nudity, with only their privy parts covered, and the
whole body besmeared with clay of different colors. The
women display considerable taste in the style of their
garments; over a petticoat, which reaches to their ankles,
and prettily bordered at the bottom, they have a dress
with sleeves down to the elbow; the skirt is open at the
sides, and does not fall as low as the petticoat, so that
the border of the latter may be seen, the bosom of the
dress is open, and on each side of the breast and round
the neck it is embroidered with coarse silk, as in Tehuantepec;
the huipil (Aztec, <i>vipilli</i>) is also worn. In country
places women wear the petticoat alone, using the overskirt
or huipil only on special occasions. When out of doors,
they cover the head and part of the face with a piece of
cotton cloth.<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> All permit the hair to attain to its full
length; the men plait theirs and wind it round the head,
leaving a short end to hang down behind, while that of
the women hangs in dark masses over their shoulders,
or is neatly bound up behind and decorated with flowers
or feathers. Herrera states that it was customary to
scorch the faces of young children to prevent the growth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
of their beards, and the men allowed the hair to grow
down over the eyebrows, making their heads and foreheads
flat on purpose. They pierced nose and ears,
ornamenting them with rings set with pearls and bits
of amber, and wore collars and bracelets of gold. Some
among them filed their teeth. They painted the face
and all exposed parts of the body in many colors, using
white or yellow with black and red, covering themselves
from the waist upward with a variety of designs and
figures. When going to battle paint was much used, in
order to render their appearance more formidable; men
tattooed on the chest, and the women mixed liquid amber
with their pigments, which, when rubbed over the body,
emitted a perfume.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ZAPOTEC BUILDINGS.</p>

<p>The better class of Zapotecs of the present day build
their houses in a substantial manner of adobes; the common
people construct a more simple dwelling with
branches arranged in a double row, and the space between
filled in with earth; they also make them of
wattled cane-work plastered with clay. Such dwellings
are cool and proof against the frequent earthquakes that
occur in their territory. Roofs are thatched with palmetto-leaves
without opening, nor are there any windows
in the walls. The interior is divided into several compartments,
according to size and necessity.<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> The Mijes
thatch their houses with bundles of coarse straw. The
Chinantecs, Chochos, and Chontales originally built no
houses, but sought out the most shady forests, where
they dwelt, or they located themselves in ravines and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
rocky parts, living in caverns or holes under the rocks;
the Tzendales of Chiapas had many towns and painted
their houses; the Ahualulcos lived together in communities,
and had commodious, well-built houses of interwoven
cane, plastered on the inside with mud, the roof
thatched with palmetto.<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PREPARATION OF FOOD.</p>

<p>From the earliest times of which we have any record,
the natives of Oajaca and the isthmus of Tehuantepec
cultivated corn and vegetables, and likewise followed
the chase; those who dwelt on the borders of the sea or
lakes applied themselves to fishing. The Zapotecs now
raise wheat, and build mills. It is asserted by an old
Spanish chronicler that this nation exceeded all others
in eating and drinking. As early as 1690, they gathered
crops of maguey, maize, Spanish peas, chile,
potatoes, and pumpkins, and bred swine and poultry.
Of late they cultivate rice, sugar-cane, and other tropical
productions, as also do the inhabitants of Tehuantepec.
Primitive agriculture has undergone but little
alteration; deer are caught by means of traps and nets.
The Miztecs, Mijes, and Cuicatecs have from the earliest
times been cultivators of the soil. The Mijes make a
coarse or impure sugar from sugar-cane; their corn-fields
are often many miles distant from their dwellings. The
Huaves, the greater portion of whom are on the borders
of the lagoons on the isthmus of Tehuantepec, live mostly
on the proceeds of their fisheries, although they raise a
small supply of grain and fruit. Their fishing is almost
exclusively done with sweep-nets in shallow waters, and
during one month of the year they catch large schools of
shrimps in traps. The Zoques produce the small quantity
of corn that they need, some <i>achote</i>, many very
fine oranges, and tobacco. They are fond of iguanas and
their eggs, and of parrots, killing the latter with stones.
The Chontales of Tabasco and Tehuantepec use maize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
and cocoa as food. They eat flesh only upon great religious
festivals, marriages, or other celebrations, but are fond
of fish. In olden times they were cannibals, and Antonio
de Herrera, the chief chronicler of the Indies, accused
also the natives of Chiapas of being eaters of human
flesh. Since the conquest the natives have lived mostly
on corn and other vegetable productions, cultivated by
themselves. A large portion of the Mayas and of the
other aborigines of Yucatan are to-day engaged in the
cultivation of the soil, they also breed such domestic animals
as they need for themselves. They are very simple
and frugal in their eating.<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> All the natives of this section
of the Mexican republic grind their maize in the
same manner; after first soaking it in lye or in lime and
water, it is bruised on the metate, or rubbing-stone,
being wet occasionally, until it becomes a soft paste.
With this they make their tortillas and other compounds,
both to eat and drink. To make tortillas the maize paste
is shaped into thin cakes with the palms of the hands and
cooked upon a flat clay pan. The <i>totoposte</i> is a smaller
cake used for journeys in lieu of the tortillas. The difference
between them is in the manner of preparation;
the totopostes are cooked one side only and laid near the
fire which makes them crisp, and require to be moistened
in order to render them eatable. Tamales are a favorite
dish and are made of pork, game, or poultry. The meat
is cut up in small pieces and washed; a small quantity of
the maize paste seasoned with cinnamon, saffron, cloves,
pimento, tomatoes, coarse pepper, salt, red coloring matter,
and some lard added to it, is placed on the fire in a
pan and as soon as it has acquired the consistency of a
thick gruel, it is removed, mixed with the meat, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>
more lard and salt added, and the mass kneaded for a few
moments. It is then divided into small portions, which
are enveloped in a thin paste of maize. The tamales
thus prepared are covered with a banana-leaf or corn-husk
and placed in a pot or pan over which large leaves
are laid. They are allowed to boil from one hour and a
half to two hours. The <i>posole</i> is a nourishing drink
made of sour maize paste mixed with water; sometimes
they add a little honey to it. They also prepare a drink
by parching corn and grinding it to powder on the metate,
and mixing it with water and a little <i>achote</i>. This
last drink they prefer to the posole, for long journeys.<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>The natives of Tehuantepec and especially those who
reside in the Goazacoalco district are neat and clean in
regard to their personal habits. They observe the custom
of bathing daily. In their ablutions they make use of a
plant called <i>chintule</i> the root of which they mix with
water, thereby imparting to their bodies a strong aromatic
odor. The same plant is used when they wash their
clothes, the scent from which remains on them for some
time. A pleasing feature in the appearance of these
people is the spotless whiteness of their cotton dresses
and the care they bestow on their luxuriant hair.</p>

<p>The other tribes who inhabit this isthmus as well as
those of Chiapas are not so clean in their persons, and
as a consequence are much infested with vermin which
the women have a disgusting habit of eating when picked
from the heads of their children. The Mayas make frequent
use of cold water, but this practice appears to be
more for pleasure than for cleansing purposes, as neither
in their persons nor in their dwellings do they present
an appearance of cleanliness.<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS AND WAR.</p>

<p>The weapons of the Southern Mexicans were in most
respects similar to those used by the Central Mexicans,
namely, bows and arrows, macanas, and lances, the latter
of great length and very strong. In Tabasco they carried
turtle-shell shields highly polished so as to reflect the
sun; they also had flint stones for lances and arrow-points,
but sometimes weapon-points were made from
strong thorns and fish-bones. The hard wooden sword
of the Maya was a heavy and formidable weapon, and
required the use of both hands to wield it; the edge was
grooved for the purpose of inserting the sharp flint with
which it was armed. Slings were commonly used by
all these nations. In addition to shields the Mayas had
for defensive armor garments of thickly quilted cotton
called <i>escaupiles</i>, which covered the body down to the
lower part of the thigh, and were considered impervious
to arrows. The flint knife of former days has now been
replaced by the machete which serves the purpose of
both cutlass and chopping-knife, and without it no native
ever goes into the woods.<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a></p>

<p>When the Spaniards first arrived at Tabasco, they
encountered a people well-skilled in the art of war, with
a fair knowledge of military tactics, who defended their
country with much bravery; their towns and villages
were well fortified with intrenchments or palisades, and
strong towers and forts were built on such places as presented
the most favorable position for resisting attacks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
To their forts they retired when invaded by a superior
force, and from the walls they hurled large rocks with
damaging effect against their foes. Cortés found erected
on the bank of the Tabasco River, in front of one of
their towns, a strong wooden stockade, with loopholes
through which to discharge arrows; and subsequently,
during his march through their country, they frequently
set fire to their villages, with the object of harassing his
troops. When advancing to battle they maintained a
regular formation, and they are described as having met
Francisco Montejo in good order, drawn up in three columns,
the centre under the command of their chief,
accompanied by their chief priest. The combatants
rushed forward to the attack with loud shouts, cheered
on by the blowing of horns and beating of small drums
called <i>tunkules</i>. Prisoners taken in battle were sacrificed
to their gods.<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p>The furniture of their houses is of the plainest description,
and limited to their absolute wants. Their
tables or benches are made of a few rough boards, and a
mat called <i>petate</i>, spread on the floor, serves for a bed,
while a coarse woolen blanket is used for covering;
some few have small cane bedsteads. The natives of
Tabasco and Yucatan more commonly have a network
<i>hamaca</i> or hammock, suspended from two posts or trees.
Their cooking-utensils consist of the metate, pots made
of earthenware, and gourds. The universal machete
carried by man and boy serves many purposes, such as
chopping firewood, killing animals, eating, and building
houses. Burgoa describes nets of a peculiar make used
by the Zapotecs for catching game; in the knots of the
net were fixed the claws of lions, tigers, bears, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span>
wild beasts of prey, and at intervals were fastened a certain
number of small stones; the object of such construction
being probably to wound or disable the animal
when caught.<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">OAJACAN MANUFACTURES.</p>

<p>The Zapotecs, Miztecs, Mayas, and others, since the
conquest, have long been justly celebrated for the manufacture
of cotton stuffs, a fact that is all the more
surprising when we consider the very imperfect implements
they possessed with which to perform the work.
Burgoa speaks of the excellence and rich quality of their
manufactures in cotton, silk, and gold thread, in 1670,
and Thomas Gage, writing about the same time, says
"it is rare to see what works those Indian women will
make in silk, such as might serve for patterns and samplers
to many Schoolmistresses in England." All the
spinning and weaving is done by the women; the cotton
clothes they make are often interwoven with beautiful
patterns or figures of birds and animals, sometimes
with gold and silk thread. A species of the agave
americana is extensively cultivated through the country,
from the fibres of which the natives spin a very strong
thread that is used chiefly for making hammocks; the
fibre is bleached and then dyed in different rich tints.
The materials they have for dyeing are so good that
the colors never fade. The Zapotecs have also an intimate
knowledge of the process of tanning skins,
which they use for several domestic purposes.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding their proximity to the sea-coast,
and although their country is in many parts intersected
by rivers and lagoons, they have a surprisingly slight
knowledge of navigation, few having any vessels with
which to venture into deep water. The inhabitants
of Tabasco, the Yucatan coast, and Cozumel island
possess some canoes made from the single trunk of a
mahogany-tree, which they navigate with small lateen
sails and paddles. The Huaves and others are in
complete ignorance of the management of any description
of boats.<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

<p>The Zoques make from the ixtle and pita thread
and superior hammocks, in which they have quite a
trade. In the neighborhood of Santa María they grow
excellent oranges, and sell them throughout all the
neighboring towns. The Zapotecs have, many of them,
a considerable commerce in fruits, vegetables, and seeds.
In the city of Tehuantepec the business of buying and
selling is conducted exclusively by women in the market-place.
The Ahualulcos are chiefly employed in
cutting planks and beams, with which they supply
many places on this isthmus; they also trade to some
extent in seeds and cotton cloths. Different kinds of
earthenware vessels for domestic purposes are made by
the natives of Chiapas, and by them exchanged for
salt, hatchets, and glass ornaments. The Mayas have
an extensive business in logwood, which, besides maize
and poultry, they transport to several places along the
coast. Mr Stephens describes a small community of
the Maya nation, numbering about a hundred men
with their families, living at a place called Schawill,
who hold and work their lands in common. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
products of the soil are shared equally by all, and the
food for the whole settlement is prepared at one hut.
Each family contributes its quota of provisions, which,
when cooked, are carried off smoking hot to their several
dwellings. Many of the natives of Tabasco earn a
livelihood by keeping bee-hives; the bees are captured
wild in the woods, and domesticated. The Huaves breed
cattle and tan hides; cheese and tasajo, or jerked meat,
are prepared and exported by them and other tribes on
the isthmus of Tehuantepec. At the present day cochineal
is cultivated to a considerable extent, and forms
an important article of commerce among the inhabitants.
A rather remarkable propensity to the possession
of large numbers of mules is peculiar to the Mijes; such
property in no way benefits them, as they make no use
of them as beasts of burden; indeed, their owners seem
to prefer carrying the loads on their own backs.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ZAPOTEC GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Formerly the Zapotecs were governed by a king,
under whom were caciques or governors who ruled over
certain districts. Their rank and power descended by
inheritance, but they were obliged to pay tribute to the
king, from whom they held their authority in fief. At
the time of the conquest the most powerful among them
was the Lord of Cuicatlan; for the service of his household,
ten servants were furnished daily, and he was
treated with the greatest respect and homage. In later
years a cacique was elected annually by the people, and
under him officers were appointed for the different villages.
Once a week these sub-officers assembled to consult
with and receive instructions from the cacique on
matters relating to the laws and regulations of their districts.
In the towns of the Miztecs a municipal form of
government was established. Certain officials, elected
annually, appointed the work which was to be done by
the people, and every morning at sunrise the town-criers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
from the tops of the highest houses called the inhabitants
to their allotted tasks. It was also the duty of
the town-criers to inflict the punishment imposed on all
who from laziness or other neglect failed to perform
their share of work. A somewhat similar system appears
to have prevailed in Chiapas, where the people
lived under a species of republican government.<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> The
Mayas were at one time governed by a king who reigned
supreme over the whole of Yucatan. Internal dissensions
and wars, however, caused their country to be
divided up into several provinces, which were ruled over
by lords or petty kings, who held complete sway, each
in his own territory, owing allegiance to none, and
recognizing no authority outside of their own jurisdiction.
These lords appointed captains of towns, who
had to perform their duties subject to their lord's approval.
Disputes arising, the captains named umpires
to determine differences, whose decisions were final.
These people had also a code of criminal laws, and
when capital punishment was ordered, public executioners
carried the sentence into effect. The crime of adultery
in the man was punishable by death, but the injured
party could claim the right to have the adulterer delivered
to him, and he could kill or pardon him at
pleasure; disgrace was the punishment of the woman.
The rape of a virgin was punished by stoning the man
to death.<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">SLAVERY AND MARRIAGE.</p>

<p>Slavery existed among the tribes of Goazacoalco and
Tabasco. Doña Marina was one of twenty female slaves
who were presented to Cortés by the cacique of the latter
place; and when her mother, who lived in the
province of Goazacoalco, gave her away to some traveling
merchants, she, to conceal the act, pretended that
the corpse of one of her slaves who died at that time
was that of her own daughter.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEDDINGS AND FATHERS-IN-LAW.</p>

<p>Among the Zapotecs and other nations who inhabit
the isthmus of Tehuantepec, marriages are contracted
at a very early age; it happens not unfrequently that
a youth of fourteen marries a girl of eleven or twelve.
Polygamy is not permissible, and gentleness, affection,
and frugality characterize the marital relations. Certain
superstitious ceremonies formerly attended the birth
of children, which, to a modified extent, exist at the
present day. When a woman was about to be confined,
the relatives assembled in the hut, and commenced
to draw on the floor figures of different animals,
rubbing each one out as soon as it was completed.
This operation continued till the moment of birth, and
the figure that then remained sketched upon the ground
was called the child's <i>tona</i> or second self. When the
child grew old enough, he procured the animal that
represented him and took care of it, as it was believed
that health and existence were bound up with that of
the animals, in fact, that the death of both would occur
simultaneously. Soon after the child was born, the
parents, accompanied by friends and relatives, carried
it to the nearest water, where it was immersed, while
at the same time they invoked the inhabitants of the
water to extend their protection to the child; in like
manner they afterwards prayed for the favor of the
animals of the land. It is a noticeable trait, much to
the credit of the parents, that their children render to
them as well as to all aged people the greatest respect
and obedience. That the women are strictly moral cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span>
be asserted. Voluptuous, with minds untrained, and
their number being greatly in excess of the men, it is
not surprising that travelers have noted an absence of
chastity among these women; yet few cases of conjugal
infidelity occur, and chastity is highly esteemed. Illegitimate
children are not common, partly the result, perhaps,
of early marriages.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> Among the Quelenes, when
a contract of marriage was made, the friends and relatives
collected at the assembly-house common to every
village. The bride and bridegroom were then introduced
by the parents, and in the presence of the cacique and
priest confessed all the sins of which they were guilty.
The bridegroom was obliged to state whether he had had
connection with the bride or with other women, and
she, on her part, made a full confession of all her shortcomings;
this ended, the parents produced the presents,
which consisted of wearing-apparel and jewelry, in which
they proceeded to array them; they were then lifted up
and placed upon the shoulders of two old men and
women, who carried them to their future home, where
they laid them on a bed, locked them in, and there left
them securely married.<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Among the Mayas early marriage
was a duty imposed by the Spanish Fathers, and
if a boy or girl at the age of twelve or fourteen had not
chosen a mate, the priest selected one of equal rank or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span>
fortune and obliged them to marry. The usual presents
were dresses; and a banquet was prepared, of which all
present partook. During the feast the parents of the
parties addressed them in speeches applicable to the
occasion, and afterwards the house was perfumed by the
priest, who then blessed the company and the ceremony
ended. Previous to the wedding-day the parents fasted
during three days. The young man built a house in
front of that of his father-in-law, in which he lived
with his wife during the first years of his servitude, for
he was obliged to work for his father-in-law four or five
years. If he failed to perform faithful service, his
father-in-law dismissed him, and gave his daughter to
another. Widowers were exempt from this servitude,
and could choose whom they pleased for a wife without
the interference of relatives. It was forbidden a man
to marry a woman of the same name as his father.
They married but one wife, though the lords were permitted
to make concubines of their slaves. Mr Stephens,
in his description of the inhabitants of the village of
Schawill, says: "Every member must marry within the
rancho, and no such thing as a marriage out of it had
ever occurred. They said it was impossible; it could
not happen. They were in the habit of going to the
villages to attend the festivals; and when we suggested
a supposable case of a young man or woman falling in
love with some village Indian, they said it might happen;
there was no law against it; but none could marry
out of the rancho. This was a thing so little apprehended,
that the punishment for it was not defined in
their penal code; but being questioned, after some consultations,
they said that the offender, whether man or
woman would be expelled. We remarked that in their
small community constant intermarriages must make
them all relatives, which they said was the case since
the reduction of their numbers by the cholera. They
were in fact all kinsfolk, but it was allowable for kinsfolk
to marry, except in the relationship of brothers and
sisters."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span></p>

<p>In divisions of property women could not inherit;
in default of direct male heirs the estate went to the
brothers or nearest male relatives. When the heir
was a minor, one of his male relatives was appointed
guardian, until the days of his minority should have
passed, when the property was delivered up to him.
The Southern Mexicans were particular to keep a strict
chronology of their lineage. Young children underwent
a kind of baptismal ceremony. The Mayas believed
that ablution washed away all evil; and previous to the
ceremony the parents fasted three days, and they were
particular to select for it what they considered a lucky
day. The age at which the rite was performed was between
three and twelve years, and no one could marry
until he had been baptized. Habits of industry as well
as respect for parents and aged people was strongly impressed
upon the minds of the children.<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p>The Southern Mexicans are fond of singing and
dancing, though there is not much variety either in
their melancholy music or monotonous dances. Their
favorite instrument is the <i>marimba</i>, composed of pieces
of hard wood of different lengths stretched across a hollowed-out
canoe-shaped case. The pieces of wood or
keys are played upon with two short sticks, one held in
each hand. The sound produced is soft and pleasing,
and not unlike that of a piano. Another instrument is
the <i>tunkul</i> or drum, made of a hollow log with sheep-skin
stretched over the end; it is struck with the fingers
of the right hand, the performer holding it under his
left arm. Their movements during their dances are
slow and graceful. The men are addicted to intoxication
at their feasts, the liquor in common use among
them being mescal and aguardiente, a colorless spirit
made from the sugar-cane. Many of the natives have
a small still in their houses.<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS IN OAJACA.</p>

<p>The Zapotecs are exceedingly polite to one another in
their common salutations, calling each other brother, and
to the descendants of their ancient caciques or lords the
utmost reverence is paid. It is related by a Mexican
writer that in a village not distant from the city of
Oajaca, whenever an aged man, the son of one of their
ancient lords was seen by the natives out walking, with
a majesty that well became his fine form, position, and
age, they uncovered their heads, kissed his hands, which
he held out to them, with much tenderness, calling him
<i>daade</i> (father), and remained uncovered until he was
lost to sight. They are a theocratic people, much addicted
to their ancient religious belief and customs.
Those who live in the vicinity of Mitla entertain a
peculiar superstition; they will run to the farthest villages
and pick up even the smallest stones that formed a
part of the mosaic work of that famous ruin, believing
that such stones will in their hands turn into gold.
Some of them hold the belief that anyone who discovers
a buried or hidden treasure has no right to appropriate
to his own use any portion of it, and that if he does,
death will strike him down within the year, in punishment
of the sacrilege committed against the spirit of the
person who hid or buried the treasure. One of the first
priests that lived among the Zapotecs says that after
they had entered the pale of the church, they still clung
to their old religious practices, and made offerings of
aromatic gums, and living animals; and that when the
occasion demanded a greater solemnity, the officiating
priest drew blood from the under part of his tongue,
and from the back part of his ears, with which he
sprinkled some thick coarse straw, held as sacred and
used at the sacrifices. To warm themselves, the Chochos,
or Chuchones, of Oajaca used, in cold weather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
towards the evening, to burn logs and dry leaves close to
the entrance of their caves, and blow the smoke into
their dwellings, which being quite full, all the family, old
and young, males and females, rushed in naked and
closed the entrance. The natives of Goazacoalco and
other places practiced some of the Jewish rites, including
a kind of circumcision, which custom they claimed
to have derived from their forefathers; hence have
arisen innumerable analogies to prove the Jewish origin
of these peoples. The Huaves still preserve ancient
customs at their feasts. It is a remarkable fact that
although nearly all these people are fishermen, very few
of them can swim. The Mijes have a habit of speaking
in very loud tones; this is attributed by some to their
haughty spirit, and by others to their manner of life in
the most rugged portion of the mountains. When bound
upon a journey, if they have no other load to carry,
they fill their <i>tonates</i>, or nets, with stones. This is generally
done by them on the return home from the market-place
of Tehuantepec. These loads rest upon their
backs, and hang by a band from their foreheads. In
ancient times, when they were in search of a new country
to settle in, they subjected the places they had
devastated to the fire proof. This was done by putting
a firebrand over night into a hole, and if it was found
extinguished in the morning, they considered that the
Sun desired his children (that is themselves) to continue
their journey. They are much given, even at the
present time, to idolatrous practices, and will make
sacrifices in their churches, if permitted, of birds as
offerings to the false gods they worshiped before their
partial conversion to Christianity. The natives attribute
eclipses of the moon to an attempt by the sun
to destroy their satellite, and to prevent the catastrophe
make a frightful uproar, employing therefor
everything they can get hold of.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>

<p class="sidenote">DISEASES AND MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>

<p>The diseases most prevalent among the Southern
Mexicans are fevers, measles, and severe colds. All
these people possess an excellent knowledge of medicinal
herbs, and make use of them in cases of pains and sickness.
They still practice some of their mysterious ceremonies,
and are inclined to attribute all complaints to
the evil influence of bewitchments. Father Baeza, in
the <i>Registro Yucateco</i>, says they consulted a crystal or
transparent stone called <i>zalzun</i>, by which they pretended
to divine the origin and cause of any sickness. When
suffering with fever or other disorders, the disease is
often much aggravated and death caused by injudicious
bathing in the rivers. In ancient times tobacco was
much used as a specific against pains arising from colds,
rheumatism, and asthma; the natives found that it
soothed the nerves and acted as a narcotic. They also
practiced bleeding with a sharp flint or fish-bone. The
Zapotecs attempted cures by means of a blow-pipe, at
the same time invoking the assistance of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p>When a death occurs the body is wrapped in a cotton
cloth, leaving the head and face uncovered, and in this
condition is placed in a grave. Very few of the ancient
funeral usages remain at the present day, though some
traces of superstitious ceremonies may still be observed
among them; such as placing food in the grave, or at
different spots in its immediate vicinity. Sometimes a
funeral is conducted with a certain degree of pomp, and
the corpse carried to its last resting-place followed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
horn-blowers, and tunkul-drummers. As in the case of
the central Mexicans, a memorial day is observed, when
much respect is shown for the memory of the dead, at
which times fruits, bread, and cakes are placed upon the
graves.<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF SOUTHERN MEXICANS.</p>

<p>The character of the inhabitants of the Tehuantepec
isthmus and Yucatan is at the present day one of
docility and mildness. With a few exceptions they are
kind-hearted, confiding, and generous, and some few of
them evince a high degree of intelligence, although the
majority are ignorant, superstitious, of loose morality as
we esteem it, yet apparently unconscious of wrong.
Cayetano Moro says they are far superior to the average
American Indian. The Zapotecs are a bold and independent
people, exhibit many intellectual qualities, and
are of an impatient disposition, though cheerful, gentle,
and inoffensive; they make good soldiers; they are
fanatical and superstitious like their neighbors. The
women are full of vivacity, of temperate and industrious
habits, their manners are characterized by shyness
rather than modesty, and they are full of intrigue. To
this nation the Mijes present a complete contrast; of all
the tribes who inhabit the isthmus, they are the most
brutal, degraded, and idolatrous; they are grossly stupid,
yet stubborn and ferocious. The Chontales and
Choles are barbarous, fierce, and quarrelsome, and greatly
addicted to witchcraft. The Cajonos and Nexitzas, of
Oajaca, are of a covetous and malicious nature, dishonest
in their dealings, and much inclined to thieving. The
Zoques are more rational in their behavior; although
they are ignorant and intemperate in their habits,
they are naturally kind and obliging, as well as patient
and enduring. The Huaves are deficient in intelligence,
arrogant and inhospitable to strangers, and of a
reticent and perverse disposition. The Miztecs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
grave and steady; they exhibit many traits of ingenuity,
are industrious, hospitable, and affable in their
manners, and retain an ardent love for liberty.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> The
Mayas exhibit many distinguished characteristics. Although
of limited intelligence, and more governed by
their senses than their reason, their good qualities
predominate. Formerly they were fierce and warlike,
but these characteristics have given place to timidity,
and they now appear patient, generous, and humane;
they are frugal and satisfied with little, being remarkably
free from avarice. Herrera describes them as
fierce and warlike, much given to drunkenness and other
sins, but generous and hospitable. Doctor Young, in
his History of Mexico, says: "They are not so intelligent
or energetic, though far more virtuous and humane
than their brethren of the north." The women
are industrious, have pleasing manners, and are inclined
to shyness. To sum it all up, I may say that the
besetting vice of these nations is intemperance, but the
habit of drinking to excess is found to be much more
common among the mountain tribes than among the
inhabitants of the lowlands. Quarrels among themselves
seldom occur, and there is abundant evidence
to show that many of them possess excellent natural
qualifications both for common labor, and artistic industry;
and that there is no cause to prevent their becoming,
under favorable circumstances, useful citizens.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>

<h4><a name="TRIBAL_VI" id="TRIBAL_VI"></a>TRIBAL BOUNDARIES.</h4>

<div class="tribal">
<p>Under the name <span class="smcap">Wild Tribes of Mexico</span>, I include all the people
inhabiting the Mexican Territory from ocean to ocean, between latitude 23°
north and the Central American boundary line south, including Yucatan and
Tehuantepec. The southernmost point of this division touches the fifteenth
degree of north latitude. A subdivision of this group is made and the parts
are called the <i>Central Mexicans</i>, and the <i>Southern Mexicans</i>, respectively. In
the former I include the nations north of an imaginary line, drawn from the
port of Acapulco, on the Pacific coast, to Vera Cruz, on the Gulf of Mexico,
and in the latter all those south of this line.</p>

<p>Going to the fountain-head of Mexican history, I find mentioned certain
names, of which it is now impossible to determine whether they are different
names applied to the same people or different peoples, or whether they
are mythical and apply to no really existing nations. Still less is it possible
to give these strange names any definite location; instance the Toltecs and
the Chichimecs, and indeed almost all early designations, very common
names used to denote very uncommon people. Sahagun is the only one of
the oldest writers who mentions the name of Toltecs, which in later years
was used by Ixtlilxochitl and Boturini, and after them bandied about more
freely by modern writers. After the conquest, the name Chichimecs was
applied to all uncivilized and unsettled people north of the valley of Mexico,
extending to the farthest discovered region. Of still other nations nothing
further can be said than that they occupied the cities to which their name
was applied; such were the Mexicans, or Aztecs, the Tlascaltecs, the Cholultecs,
and many others. Some general remarks respecting the location of the
principal civilized nations, will be found in vol. ii., chap. ii., of this work;
and all obtainable details concerning the many tribes that cannot be definitely
located here are given in volume v.</p>

<span class="s08">WILD TRIBES OF CENTRAL AMERICA.</span></h3>

<p class="ch_summ">
<span class="smcap">Physical Geography and Climate&mdash;Three Groupal Divisions; First, the
nations of Yucatan, Guatemala, Salvador, Western Honduras, and
Nicaragua; Second, The Mosquitos of Honduras; Third, the nations
of Costa Rica and the Isthmus of Panamá&mdash;The Popolucas,

Savanerics, Sayrones, Viscitas, and others living in Costa Rica
and on the Isthmus.</span></p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Wild Tribes of Central America</span>, which territorial
group completes the line of our Pacific States
seaboard, I make three divisions following modern geographical
boundaries, namely, the aborigines of Guatemala,
Salvador, and Nicaragua, which I call <i>Guatemalans</i>;
the people of the Mosquito Coast and Honduras, <i>Mosquitos</i>;
and the nations of Costa Rica and the isthmus of
Darien, or Panamá, <i>Isthmians</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF CENTRAL AMERICA.</p>

<p>The territory occupied by this group of nations lies
between the eighteenth and the seventh parallels of north
latitude, that is to say, between the northern boundary
of the Central American states, and the river Atrato,
which stream nearly severs the Isthmus from the South
American continent. This continental tract is a narrow,
irregular, indented coast-country of volcanic character,
in which Guatemala and Honduras alone present any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
considerable breadth. The two cordilleras, running
through Mexico and meeting on the isthmus of Tehuantepec,
continue their course through Guatemala, where
they form a broken table-land studded with elevations, of
less height than the plateaux of Mexico. After sinking
considerably at the isthmus formed by the gulf of Honduras,
this mountain range takes a fresh start and offers
a formidable barrier along the Pacific coast, which sends
a number of transverse ranges into the interior of Honduras,
and gives rise to countless rivers, chiefly emptying
into the Atlantic. The chain passes at a diminished altitude
through Nicaragua, where it forms a large basin, which
holds the lakes of Nicaragua and Managua; but on reaching
Costa Rica it again becomes a bold, rugged range, capped
by the volcano of Cartago. Seemingly exhausted by its
wild contortions, it dwindles into a series of low ridges
on entering Veragua, and passes in this form through the
isthmus of Panamá, until it unites with the South American
Andes. The scenery of this region is extremely
varied, uniting that of most countries of the globe; lakes,
rivers, plains, valleys, and bays abound in all forms
and sizes. The north-east trade winds blow the greater
part of the year, and, meeting the high ranges, deposit
their superabundant moisture upon the eastern side,
which is damp, overgrown with rank vegetation, filled
with marshes, and unhealthful. The summer here, is
hot and fever-breeding. Relieved of their moisture, and
cooled by the mountains, the trade winds continue their
course through the gaps left here and there, and tend
materially to refresh the atmosphere of the Pacific slope
for a part of the year; while the south-west winds, blowing
from May to October, for a few hours at a time, bring
short rains to temper what would otherwise be the hot
season on this coast. Dew falls everywhere, except in
the more elevated regions, and keeps vegetation fresh.
Palms, plantains, mahogany, and dye-woods abound in
the hot district; maize flourishes best in the temperate
parts, while cedars, pines, and hardier growths find a
home in the tierra fria. The animal kingdom is best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
represented on the Atlantic side, for here the puma, the
tiger-cat, and the deer, startled only by the climbing
opossum or the chattering monkey, find a more secure
retreat. Birds of brilliant plumage fill the forests
with their songs, while the buzz of insects everywhere
is heard as they swarm over sweltering alligators,
lizards, and snakes. The manifold productions, and varied
features of the country have had, no doubt, a great influence
in shaping the destiny of the inhabitants. The
fine climate, good soil, and scarcity of game on the Pacific
side must have contributed to the allurements of a settled
life and assisted in the progress of nations who had for
centuries before the conquest lived in the enjoyment of a
high culture. It is hard to say what might have been the
present condition of a people so happily situated, but the
advent of the white race, bent only upon the acquirement
of present riches by means of oppression, checked the
advancement of a civilization which struck even the invaders
with admiration. Crossing to the Atlantic side we
find an over-abundant vegetation, whose dark recesses
serve as a fitting shelter for the wild beast. Here man,
imbibing the wildness of his surroundings, and oppressed
by a feverish climate, seems content to remain in a savage
state depending upon natural fruits, the chase, and fishing
for his subsistence. Of a roaming disposition, he
objects to the restraint imposed by government and forms.
The natives of Costa Rica and the isthmus of Darien
escaped the civilizing influence of foreign intercourse,&mdash;thanks
to their geographical isolation,&mdash;and remain on
about the same level of culture as in their primitive
days.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS.</p>

<p>Under the name of <span class="smcap">Guatemalans</span>, I include the natives
of Guatemala, Salvador, and Nicaragua. I have
already pointed out the favorable features of the region
inhabited by them. The only sultry portion of Guatemala
is a narrow strip along the Pacific; it is occupied by
a few planters and fishermen, who find most of their requirements
supplied by the palms that grow here in the
greatest luxuriance. The chief part of the population is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
concentrated round the various lakes and rivers of the
table-land above, where maize, indigo, cochineal, and
sugar-cane are staple products. In the altos, the banana
is displaced by hardier fruits sheltered under the lofty
cedar, and here we find a thrifty and less humble people
who pay some attention to manufactures. Salvador
presents less abrupt variation in its features. Although
outside of the higher range of mountains, it still possesses
a considerable elevation running through its entire length,
which breaks out at frequent intervals into volcanic peaks,
and gives rise to an abundant and well-spread water
system. Such favorable conditions have not failed to
gather a population which is not only the most numerous
comparatively, but also the most industrious in Central
America. Northern Nicaragua is a continuation of Salvador
in its features and inhabitants; but the central
and southern parts are low and have more the character
of the Guatemalan coast, the climate being hot, yet not
unhealthful. Its Atlantic coast region, however, partakes
of the generally unfavorable condition described
above.</p>

<p>The Spanish rulers naturally exercised a great influence
upon the natives, and their ancient civilization was
lost in the stream of Caucasian progress, a stream which,
in this region, itself flowed but slowly in later times.
Oppressed and despised, a sullen indifference has settled
upon the race, and caused it to neglect even its
traditions. The greater portion still endeavor to keep
up tribal distinctions and certain customs; certain
tribes of lesser culture, as the cognate <i>Manches</i> and <i>Lacandones</i>,
retired before the Spaniards to the north and
north-east, where they still live in a certain isolation
and independence. The name Lacandones has been
applied to a number of tribes, of which the eastern are
described to be quite harmless as compared with the
western. The <i>Quichés</i>, a people living in the altos,
have also surrounded themselves with a certain reserve,
and are truer to their ancient customs than the <i>Zutugils</i>,
<i>Cakchiquels</i>, and many others related by language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
to the Quichés surrounding them. The <i>Pipiles</i>, meaning
children, according to Molina, are the chief people
in Salvador, where their villages are scattered over a
large extent of territory. In Nicaragua we find several
distinct peoples. The aboriginal inhabitants seem to
have been the different peoples known as <i>Chorotegans</i>,
who occupy the country lying between the bay of Fonseca
and lake Nicaragua. The <i>Chontales</i> (strangers, or
barbarians) live to the north-east of the lakes, and
assimilate more to the barbarous tribes of the Mosquito
country adjoining them. The <i>Cholutecs</i> inhabit the
north from the gulf of Fonseca towards Honduras. The
<i>Orotiñans</i> occupy the country south of the lake of Nicaragua
and around the gulf of Nicoya. Further information
about the location of the different nations and tribes
of this family will be found at the <a href="#TRIBAL_VII">end of this chapter</a>.<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSIQUE AND DRESS.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Guatemalans</span>, that is to say the aborigines of
Guatemala, Salvador, and Nicaragua, are rather below
the middle size, square and tough, with a finely developed
physique. Their hue is yellow-brown, in some
parts coppery, varying in shade according to locality,
but lighter than that of the standard American type.
The full round face has a mild expression; the forehead
is low and retiring, the cheek-bones protruding, chin and
nose short, the latter thick and flat, lips full, eyes black
and small, turned upwards at the temples, with a stoical,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span>
distrustful look. The cranium is slightly conical; hair
long, smooth, and black, fine but strong, retaining its
color well as old age approaches, though sometimes turning
white. Although the beard is scanty, natives may
be seen who have quite a respectable moustache. The
limbs are muscular, the calf of the leg being especially
large; hands and feet small; a high instep, which, no
doubt, partly accounts for their great endurance in
walking. The women are not devoid of good looks,
especially in Nicaragua, where, in some districts, they
are said to be stronger and better formed than the men.
The custom of carrying pitchers of water upon the head,
gives to the women an erect carriage and a firm step.
The constitution of the males is good, and, as a rule,
they reach a ripe old age; the females are less long-lived.
Deformed persons are extremely rare. Guatemala, with
its varied geographical aspects, presents striking differences
in physique; the highlanders being lighter in complexion,
and finer in form and features than the
inhabitants of the lowlands.<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GUATEMALAN DRESS AND ORNAMENTS.</p>

<p>Intercourse with Spaniards seems to have produced
little change in the dress of the Guatemalans, which is
pretty much the same as that of the Mexicans. The
poorer class wear a waist-cloth of white cotton, or of <i>pita</i>,
which is a kind of white hemp, or a long shirt of the
same material, with short sleeves, partly open at the
sides, the ends of which are passed between the legs,
and fastened at the waist; a strip of cotton round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
head, surmounted by a dark-colored hat of straw or
palm-leaves, with a very wide brim, completes the attire.
This cotton cap or turban is an indispensable article of
dress to the highlander, who passes suddenly from the
cold air of the hilly country, to the burning plains below.
Sumptuary regulations here obtain, as aboriginally the
lower classes were not allowed to wear anything better
than pita clothing, cotton being reserved for the nobles.
The primitive dress of the nobility is a colored waist-cloth,
and a mantle ornamented and embroidered with
figures of birds, tigers, and other designs, and, although
they have adopted much of the Spanish dress, the rich
and fanciful stitchings on the shirt, still distinguish them
from their inferiors. On feast-days, and when traveling,
a kind of blanket, commonly known as <i>serape</i>, <i>manga</i>,
or <i>poncho</i>, is added to the ordinary dress. The serape,
which differs in style according to locality, is closer in
texture than the ordinary blanket and colored, checked,
figured, or fringed, to suit the taste. It has an opening
in the centre, through which the head is passed, and
hanging in loose folds over the body it forms a very
picturesque attire. Some fasten it with a knot on one
shoulder, leaving it to fall over the side from the other.
The serape also serves for rain-coat and wrapper, and,
at night, it is wound round the head and body, serving
for bed as well as covering, the other portion of the dress
being made into a pillow. The carriers of Guatemala
use a rain-proof palm-leaf called <i>suyacal</i>. Shepherds
are distinguished by a black and white checked apron,
somewhat resembling the Scotch kilt. The hair, which,
before the conquest of Guatemala, was worn long, and
hung in braids down the back, is now cut short, except
in the remote mountain districts, where long loose hair
is still the fashion. In Salvador and Nicaragua, on the
other hand, the front part of the hair used to be shaved
off, the brave often appearing perfectly bald. Most
natives go bare-footed, except when traveling; they then
put on sandals, which consist of a piece of hide fastened
by thongs. The women, when at home, content themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
with a waist-cloth, generally blue-checked, secured
by a twisted knot; but, on going abroad, they put on
the huipil, which is a piece of white cotton, having an
opening in the middle for the head, and covering the
breast and back, as far as the waist. Some huipils are
sewed together at the sides and have short sleeves. On
this part of their dress the women&mdash;who, for that matter,
attend to the manufacture and dyeing of all the clothing&mdash;expend
their best efforts. They embroider, or dye,
the neck and shoulders with various designs, whose outlines
and coloring often do great credit to their taste.
In Guatemala, the colors and designs are distinct for
different villages, so that it may at once be seen to which
tribe the wearer belongs. The hair is plaited into one
or two braids, interlaced with bright-colored ribbons,
and usually wreathed turban-fashion round the head.
The Quichés, whose red turban-dress is more pronounced
than others, sometimes vary it by adding yellow bands
and tassels to the braids, which are permitted to hang
down to the heels. Thomas Gage, who lived in Guatemala
from about 1627 to 1638, relates that on gala-days the
fair natives were arrayed in cotton veils reaching to the
ground. The ancient custom of painting, and of piercing
the ears and lip, to hold pendants, is now restricted
to the remote hill country, and ornaments are limited to
a few strings of beads, shells, and metal for the arms
and neck, with an occasional pair of ear-rings; the
women add flowers and garlands to their head-dress,
especially on feast-days. Some mountain tribes of
Guatemala wear red feathers in their cotton turbans&mdash;the
nobles and chiefs using green ones&mdash;and paint the
body black: the paint being, no doubt, intended for a
protection against mosquitos. The apron worn by the
women is made of bark, which, after being soaked and
beaten, assumes the appearance of chamois leather. The
Lacandones also wore cotton sacks adorned with tassels,
and the women had bracelets of cords with tassels. In
Nicaragua, tattooing seems to have been practiced, for
Oviedo says that the natives cut their faces and arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
with flint knives, and rubbed a black powder obtained
from pine gum into the scars. Children wear no other
dress than that provided by nature: here and there, however,
the girls are furnished with a strip of cotton for
the waist.<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GUATEMALAN DWELLINGS.</p>

<p>The conquerors have left numerous records of large
cities with splendid palaces and temples of stone, but
these exist now only in their ruins. The masses had,
doubtless, no better houses than those we see at present.
Their huts are made of wooden posts and rafters supporting
a thatched roof of straw or palm-leaves, the
side being stockaded with cane, bamboo, or rush, so as
to allow a free passage to the air. Generally they have
but one room; two or three stones in the centre of the
hut compose the fireplace, and the only egress for the
smoke is through the door. The room is scantily furnished
with a few mats, a hammock, and some earthenware.
Their villages are generally situated upon rising
ground, and, owing to the houses being so scattered,
they often extend over a league, which gives some
foundation to the statements of the conquerors reporting
the existence of towns of enormous size. The better
kind of villages have regular streets, a thing not to be
seen in the ordinary hamlets; and the houses, which are
often of <i>adobes</i> (sun-burnt bricks), or of cane plastered
over, containing two or three rooms and a loft, are surrounded
by neatly kept gardens, enclosed within hedges.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
When a Guatemalan wishes to build a hut, or repair
one, he notifies the chief, who summons the tribe to
bring straw and other needful materials, and the work
is finished in a few hours; after which the owner supplies
the company with chocolate. Some of the Vera
Paz tribes are of a roaming disposition. They will take
great trouble in clearing and preparing a piece of ground
for sowing, and, after one or two harvests, will leave for
another locality. Their dwellings, which are often
grouped in hamlets, are therefore of a more temporary
character, the walls being of maize-stalks and sugar-cane,
surmounted by a slight palm-leaf roof. During an expedition
into the country of the Lacandones, the Spaniards
found a town of over one hundred houses, better constructed
than the villages on the Guatemalan plateau.
In the centre of the place stood three large buildings, one
a temple, and the other two assembly houses, for men and
women respectively. All were enclosed with fences
excellently varnished. The Nicaraguan villages seem
to be the neatest; the houses are chiefly of plaited cane
or bamboo frame-work, raised a few feet from the
ground, and standing in the midst of well-arranged flowers
and shrubbery. Dollfus describes a simple but ingenious
method used by the Guatemalans to cross deep
rivers. A stout cable of aloe-fibres is passed over the
stream, and fixed to the banks at a sufficient height
from the surface of the water. To this rope bridge,
called <i>garucha</i>, is attached a running strap, which the
traveler passes round his body, and is pulled across by
men stationed on the opposite side.<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>

<p>These natives are essentially agricultural, but, like all
who inhabit the warm zone, desire to live with the least
possible labor. Most of them are content with a small
patch of ground round their huts, on which they cultivate,
in the same manner as did their forefathers, the little
maize, beans, and the banana and plantain trees necessary
for their subsistence. There are, however, a number
of small farmers, who raise cochineal, cacao, indigo, and
cotton, thereby adding to their own and their country's
prosperity. In the more thinly settled districts, hunting
enables them to increase the variety of their food with
the flesh of wild hogs, deer, and other game, which are
generally brought down with stone-headed arrows.
When hunting the wild hog, they stretch a strong net,
with large meshes, in some part of the woods, and drive
the animals towards it. These rush headlong into the
meshes, and are entangled, enabling their pursuers to
dispatch them with ease.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE GUATEMALANS.</p>

<p>Beans, and tortillas of maize, with the inevitable chile
for seasoning, and plantains or bananas are their chief
food. To these may be added meat in small quantities,
fish, eggs, honey, turtle, fowl, and a variety of fruit and
roots. Salt is obtained by boiling the soil gathered on
the sea-shore. Maize is prepared in several ways. When
young and tender, the ears are boiled, and eaten with
salt and pepper; or a portion of them are pressed, and
the remainder boiled with the juice thus extracted.
When ripe, the fruit is soaked and then dried between
the hands, previous to being crushed to flour between
two stones. It is usually made into tortillas, which are
eaten hot, with a strong sprinkling of pepper and occasionally
a slight addition of fat. <i>Tamales</i> is the name
for balls of cooked maize mixed with beef and chile, and
rolled in leaves. A favorite dish is a dumpling made of
maize and frijoles. The frijoles, or beans, of which a stock
is always kept, are boiled a short time with chile; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
are then mixed with maize, and again put into the pot
until thoroughly cooked, when they are eaten with a
sauce made of salt, chile, and water. There are a number
of fluid and solid preparations made chiefly from
maize, and known as <i>atole</i>, to which name various prefixes
are added to denote the other ingredients used.
Meat, which is usually kept jerked, is a feast-day food.
Gage describes the jerking process as follows: Fresh
meat is cut into long strips, salted, and hung between
posts to dry in the sun for a week. The strips are then
smoked for another week, rolled up in bundles, which
become quite hard, and are called <i>tassajo</i> or <i>cesina</i>.
Another mode of preparing meat is described by the
same author: When a deer has been shot, the body is
left until decay and maggots render it appetizing; it is
then brought home and parboiled with a certain herb
until the flesh becomes sweet and white. The joint is
afterwards again boiled, and eaten with chile. The Lacandones
preserve meat as follows: A large hole is made
in the ground, and lined with stones. After the hole has
been heated, the meat is thrown in, and the top covered
with leaves and earth, upon which a fire is kept burning.
The meat takes four hours to cook, and can be
preserved for eight or ten days. Cacao forms an important
article of food, both as a drink and as bread.
The kernel is picked when ripe, dried on a mat, and
roasted in an earthen pan, previous to being ground to
flour. Formerly, cacao was reserved for the higher
classes, and even now the poor endeavor to economize it
by adding <i>sapuyal</i>, the kernel of the <i>sapote</i>. They observe
no regularity in their meals, but eat and drink at
pleasure. When traveling, some roasted maize paste
called <i>totoposte</i>, crumbled in boiling water with an addition
of salt and pepper, and a cup of warm water, suffice
for a repast. Fire is obtained in the usual primitive
manner, by rubbing two sticks together.<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span></p>

<p>Most authorities agree that they are clean in their
habits, and that frequent bathing is the rule, yet it is
hinted that leprosy is caused partially by uncleanliness.<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WAR, WEAPONS, AND IMPLEMENTS.</p>

<p>Since the Spaniards assumed control of the country,
weapons, as applied to war, have fallen into disuse, and
it is only in the mountain districts that we meet the
hunter armed with bow and spear, and slung over his
shoulder a quiver full of reed arrows, pointed with stone.
In Salvador and Nicaragua, the natives are still very expert
in the use of the sling, game often being brought
down by it.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>I find no record of any wars among the aborigines
since the conquest, and the only information relating to
their war customs, gathered from the account of skirmishes
which the Spaniards have had with some of the
tribes in eastern Guatemala, is, that the natives kept in
the back-ground, hidden by rocks or trees, waiting for
the enemy to approach. As soon as the soldiers came
close enough, a cloud of arrows came whizzing among
them, and the warriors appeared, shouting with all their
might. The Lacandones occasionally retaliate upon the
planters on their borders for ill-treatment received at
their hands. A number of warriors set out at night
with faggots of dry sticks and grass, which are lighted as
they approach the plantation, and thrown into the enemy's
camp; during the confusion that ensues, the proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
reprisal is made. One writer gives a brief description of
the ceremonies preceding and following their expeditions.
In front of the temple are burning braziers filled
with odoriferous resin; round this the warriors assemble
in full dress, their arms being placed behind them. A
smaller brazier of incense blazes in front of each warrior,
before which he prostrates himself, imploring the aid of
the Great Spirit in his enterprise. On their return,
they again assemble, disguised in the heads of various
animals, and go through a war dance before the chief
and his council. Sentinels are always pacing the summit
of the hills, and give notice to one another, by trumpet
blast, of the approach of any stranger. If it is an
enemy, they speedily form ambuscades to entrap him.<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a></p>

<p>I have already referred to the bare interior of their
dwellings: a few mats, a hammock, and some earthenware
being the only apology for furniture. The mats
are plaited of bark or other fibres, and serve, among
other purposes, as a bed for the children, the grown
persons generally sleeping in hammocks attached to the
rafters. Scattered over the floor may be seen the
earthen jar which the women so gracefully balance on
their head when bringing it full of water from the
well; the earthen pot for boiling plantains, with its
folded banana-leaf cover; cups made from clay, calabash,
cocoa-nut, or wacal shells, with their stands, often
polished and bearing the marks of native sculpture; the
metate for grinding the family flour; the <i>comal</i>, a clay
plate upon which the tortilla is baked. A banana-leaf
serves for a plate, and a fir-stick does the duty of a
candle. Their hunting or bag nets are made of pita or
bark-fibres. The steel machete and the knife have entirely
displaced their ancient silex tools, of which some
relics may still be found among the Lacandones. Valenzuela
mentions that in the meeting-house of this
tribe, the conquerors found two hundred hanging seats.<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span></p>

<p>These natives still excel in the manufacture of pottery,
and produce, without the aid of tools, specimens that
are as remarkable for their fanciful forms, as for their
elegance and coloring. Water-jars are made sufficiently
porous to allow the water to percolate and keep the contents
cool; other earthenware is glazed by rubbing the
heated vessel with a resinous gum. Nor are they behind-hand
in the art of weaving, for most of the fabrics used
in the country are of native make. The aboriginal
spinning machine is not yet wholly displaced, and consists,
according to Squier, of a thin spindle of wood,
fifteen or sixteen inches in length, which is passed
through a wheel of hard, heavy wood, six inches in diameter,
and resembles a gigantic top. When used, it is
placed in a hollowed piece of wood, to prevent it from
toppling over. A thread is attached to the spindle just
above the wheel, and it is then twirled rapidly between
the thumb and forefinger. The momentum of the wheel
keeps it in motion for half a minute, and meantime the
thread is drawn out by the operator from the pile of
prepared cotton in her lap. Their mode of weaving is
the same as that of the Mexicans, and the fabrics are
not only durable, but tastefully designed and colored to
suit the quality and price. The dyes used are, indigo
for blue, cochineal for red, and indigo mixed with lemon
juice for black. The Nicaraguans obtain a highly prized
purple by pressing the valve of a shell-fish found on the
sea-shore. Baily says that they take the material to
the seaside, and, after procuring a quantity of fresh
coloring matter, dip each thread singly into it, and lay
it aside to dry. From the aloe, and pita, or silk-grass,
which are very strong and can easily be bleached, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
obtain a very fine thread, suitable for the finest weaving.
Reeds and bark give material for coarser stuff, such as
ropes and nets. Mats and hammocks, which are made
from any of the last-mentioned fibres, are often interwoven
with gray colors and rich designs. Some idea
may be formed of the patient industry of the native
when we learn that he will work for months upon one
of the highly prized hats made from the fibre of the
half-formed <i>carludovica palmata</i> leaf. They drill holes
in stones, for pipes and other objects, by twirling a stick
rapidly between the hands in some sand and water placed
upon the stone.<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GUATEMALAN CANOES.</p>

<p>Canoes are the usual 'dug-outs,' made from a single
cedar or mahogany log, cedar being liked for its lightness,
mahogany for its durability. They are frequent
enough on the coast, and even the north-eastern Guatemalans
used to muster fleets of several hundred canoes
on their lakes and rivers, using them for trade as well as
war. Pim, when at Greytown, particularly observed
the hollowed-out boats, some upwards of fifty feet in
length, and straight as an arrow. He says that they are
very skillfully handled, and may be seen off the harbor
in any weather. The paddles, which are used both for
steering and propelling, are of light mahogany, four feet
long, with very broad blades, and a cross at the handle.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a></p>

<p>Their wealth, which, since the conquest, mostly consists
of household goods, is the product of their farms and industry
mentioned under food, implements, and manufactures.
The coast tribes, in Salvador, have a source of
wealth not yet referred to&mdash;balsam&mdash;and they are very
jealous of their knowledge of obtaining it. The process,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
as described by Dollfus, is to make several deep incisions
in the trunk of the balsam-tree, and stuff the holes
with cotton rags. When these have absorbed sufficient
balm, they are placed in jars of water, and submitted
to a moderate heat. The heat separates the substance
from the rags, and the balsam rises to the surface to be
skimmed and placed in well-closed jars for shipment.
These people possess no written records to establish ownership
to their property, but hold it by ancient rights
transmitted from father to son, which are transferable.
The right of first discovery, as applied to fruit-trees and
the like, is respected, and can be transmitted. Goods
and lands are equally divided among the sons. There
is a general interchange of products on a small scale,
and as soon as the farm yield is ready, or a sufficient
quantity of hammocks, mats, hats, and cups have been
prepared, the native will start on a short trading-tour,
with the load on his back&mdash;for they use no other mode
of transport. The ancient custom of holding frequent
markets in all towns of any importance has not quite
disappeared, for Masaya, among other places, continues
to keep a daily <i>tianguez</i>. Cacao-beans, which were formerly
the chief currency, are still used for that purpose
to a certain extent, and make up a large item in their
wealth. The Lacandones at one time drove a brisk
trade on the rio de la Pasion, employing several hundred
canoes, but this has now greatly diminished, and
they seem to grow less and less inclined to intercourse.
Hardcastle relates that two shy mountain tribes of Guatemala
"exchange dogs and a species of very sharp red
pepper, by leaving them on the top of the mountain,
and going to the spot in turn."<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ART AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>The native's aptitude for art is well illustrated by the
various products of his industry, decorated as they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
with fanciful designs, carvings, and coloring. The calabash
cups are widely circulated, and the artistic carving
of leaves, curious lines, and figures of all descriptions, in
relief, with which the outside is ornamented, has been
much admired. No less esteemed are the small Guatemalan
earthen figures, painted in natural colors, representing
the various trades and occupations of the people,
which may be said to rival European productions of the
same character. The ornaments on their pottery bear
some resemblance to the Etruscan. They are equally
advanced in painting, for many of the altar-pieces in
Central America are from the native brush, and their
dishes are often richly colored in various designs. Original
lyric poetry seems to flourish among them, and is
not wanting in grace, although the rendering of it may
not be exactly operatic. The subject generally refers to
victorious encounters with monsters, but contains also
sarcasms on government and society.<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>A reverential respect for authority is innate with these
people, and the chief, usually a descendant of the ancient
caciques, who is also the head of the municipal government
introduced among them by the Spaniards, receives
the homage paid him with imperturbable gravity.
These chiefs form a proud and powerful noblesse, who
rule with an iron hand over their submissive followers.
Although governed to all appearance by the code of the
country, they have their own laws based on custom and
common sense, which are applied to civil as well as
criminal cases. Among the Lacandones, the chief is
elected by a council of old men, when death, misconduct,
or the superior abilities of some one else call for such a
step. Pontelli adds that the new chief is invested with
lion-skins and a collar of human teeth to represent his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
victories; a crown of feathers or a lion-skin is his usual
distinctive head-dress. The wife of the chief is required
to possess some rare qualities. These people are very
strict in executing the law; the offender is brought before
the old men, and if the crime is serious his relatives
have often to share in his punishment. The people of
Salvador, according to Dollfus, have frequent reunions
in their council-house at night. The hall is then lighted
up by a large fire, and the people sit with uncovered
heads, listening respectfully to the observations and decisions
of the <i>ahuales</i>&mdash;men over forty years of age, who
have occupied public positions, or distinguished themselves
in some way. Gage makes a curious statement
concerning the rio Lempa that may be based upon some
ancient law. Any man who committed a heinous crime
on the one side of the river, and succeeded in escaping
to the other, was allowed to go unmolested, provided
he did not return.<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MARRIAGE AND CHILDBIRTH.</p>

<p>Marriages take place at an early age, often before puberty,
and usually within the tribe. When the boy, in
Guatemala and Salvador, has attained the age of nine,
his parents begin to look around for a bride for him, the
mother having a good deal to say in this matter. Presents
are made to the parents of the girl chosen, and she
is transferred to the house of her future father-in-law,
where she is treated as a daughter, and assists in the
household duties, until she is old enough to marry. It
sometimes happens that she has by this time become distasteful
to the affianced husband, and is returned to her
parents. The presents given for her are then demanded
back, a refusal naturally follows, and feuds result, lasting
for generations. Gage states that when the parties
to the betrothal are of different tribes, the chiefs are
notified, and meet in solemn conclave to consult about
the expediency of the alliance. The consultations often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
extend over a period of several months, during which
the parents of the boy supply the council with refreshments,
and make presents to the girl's family for her
purchase. If the council disagree, the presents are returned,
and the matter drops. When the youth has
reached his sixteenth or eighteenth year, and the maid
her fourteenth, they are considered able to take care of
themselves; a house is accordingly built, and the father
gives his son a start in life. The cacique and relations
are summoned to witness the marriage ceremony, now
performed by the priest, after which the pair are carried
upon the shoulders of their friends to the new house,
placed in a room, and shut in. The bride brings no
dowry, but presents are made by the friends of the
families. Several tribes in Guatemala are strictly opposed
to marriages outside of the tribe, and destroy the
progeny left by a stranger. The Lacandones still practice
polygamy, each wife having a separate house and
field for her support. In Nicaragua, where women are
more independent, and fewer of the ancient marriage customs
have been retained than elsewhere, the ceremony is
often quickly disposed of, the husband and wife returning
to their avocations immediately after. The life of
the woman is one of drudgery; household duties, weaving,
and the care of children keeping her constantly
busy, while the husband is occupied in dolce far niente;
yet their married life is not unhappy. Although the
female dresses scantily and is not over shy when bathing,
she is by no means immodest or unchaste, but bears rather
a better character than women of the superior race.
Childbirth is not attended with any difficulties, for it
sometimes happens that the woman, after being delivered
on the road, will wash the child and herself in the
nearest stream, and proceed on her journey, as if nothing
had occurred. The Quichés, among others, still call
in the sorcerer to take the horoscope of the new-born,
and to appeal to the gods in its behalf. He also gives
the infant the name of some animal, which becomes
its guardian spirit for life. Belly states that more boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span>
are born to the natives, while the whites have more
girls. The mother invariably nurses the child herself
until its third year, and, when at work, carries it on
her back in a cloth passed round her body; the movements
of the mother in washing or kneading tending
to rock the infant to sleep. Otherwise the child is
little cared for, and has to lie on the bare ground,
or, at most, with a mat under it. As the boy grows
older the father will take him into the field and forest,
suiting the work to his strength, and instructing him in
the use of tools, while the mother takes charge of the
girl, teaching her to cook, spin, and weave. Respect
for parents and older people is inculcated, and children
never presume to speak before a grown person unless
first addressed. They remain under the parents' roof
until married, and frequently after, several generations
often living together in one house under the rule of
the eldest. The native is fond of home, for here he
escapes from the contempt of the other races, and reigns
supreme over a family which is taught to respect him:
patriotism has been replaced by love of home among
this oppressed people.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GUATEMALAN MUSIC.</p>

<p>Their amusements are less common and varied than
among the whites, and are generally reserved for special
occasions, when they are indulged in to excess. Still,
they have orderly gatherings round the hearth, at which
wondrous and amusing stories form the chief part of the
entertainment. Songs follow in natural order, and are
loudly applauded by the listeners, who join in repeating
the last words of the verse. The subject, as given by
some local poet, or transmitted from an ancient bard, is
pleasing enough, but the rendering is in a plaintive, disagreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
monotone. Their instrumental music is an
improvement on the vocal, in some respects, and practice
has enabled the player to execute pieces from
memory with precision and accord. The <i>marimba</i>, a
favorite instrument, consists of a series of vertical tubes
of different length but equal diameter, fastened together
in a line by bark fibre, and held firm between two pieces
of wood. The tubes have a lateral opening at the base
covered with a membrane, and the upper end is closed
by a small, movable elastic plate, upon which the performer
strikes with light drumsticks. The play of the
plates causes a compression of air in the tube, and a
consequent vibration of the membrane, which produces
a sound differing in character according to the length of
the tube. All the parts are of wood, the tube being,
however, occasionally of terra-cotta, or replaced by calabash-shells.
The marimba of usual size is over a yard in
length, and consists of twenty-two tubes ranging from
four to sixteen inches in length, forming three complete
octaves. The pitch is regulated by a coating of wax on
the key-plates. Some drumsticks are forked to strike
two plates at once. Occasionally, several persons join
in executing an air upon the instrument, or two marimbas
are played in perfect accord with some song. Their
usual drum is called <i>tepanabaz</i>, described by Gage as a
smooth hollow trunk with two or three clefts on the
upper side and holes at the ends. It is beaten with two
sticks, and produces a dull heavy sound. Other drums
covered with wild goat skin, tortoise-shells, pipes, small
bells, and rattles, are chiefly used at dances. The Lacandones
possess a kind of mandolin, a double-necked, truncated
cone, with one string, made to pass four times
over the bridge; also a clarionet-like instrument named
<i>chirimiya</i>; their drum is called <i>tepanahuaste</i>. A dance
is generally a grand affair with the native, combining as
it does dress with dramatic and saltatory exhibitions.
At the <i>tocontin</i> dance, in Guatemala, from twenty to forty
persons dressed in white clothes richly embroidered,
and bedecked with gaudy bands, colored feathers in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
gilt frames fastened on the back, fanciful helmets topped
with feathers, and feathers, again, on their legs, in form
of wings. The conductor stands in the centre beating
time on the tepanabaz, while the dancers circle round
him, one following the other, sometimes straight, sometimes
turning half-way, at other times fully round, and
bending the body to the ground, all the time shouting
the fame of some hero. This continues for several hours,
and is often repeated in one house after another. In
another dance they disguise themselves with skins of
different animals, acting up to the character assumed,
and running in and out of the circle formed round the
musicians, striking, shrieking, and hotly pursuing some
particular performer. There are also several dances like
those of the Mexicans, in which men dress in women's
clothes and other disguises. The Nicaraguan dances
vary but little from the above. Several hundred people
will gather in some well-cleared spot, their arms and
legs ornamented with strings of shells, their heads with
feathers, and with fans in their hands. The leader,
walking backwards, commences some movements to be
imitated by the dancers, who follow in threes and fours,
turning round, intermingling, and again uniting. The
musicians beat drums and sing songs to which the leader
responds, the dancers taking up the refrain in their turn,
and shaking their calabash rattles. After a while they
pass round each other and perform the most curious
antics and grimaces, crying, laughing, posturing, acting
lame, blind, and so on. Drinking is inseparable from
these reunions, and they do not usually break up until
all have attained the climax of their wishes&mdash;becoming
helplessly drunk. The principal drinks are, atole
made from maize, but which assumes different prefixes,
according to the additional ingredients used, as <i>istatole</i>,
<i>jocoatole</i>, etc.; pulque, chiefly used in the highlands; and,
not least, <i>chicha</i>, made from maize and various fruits
and roots, fermented with honey or sugar-cane juice.
Gage states that tobacco-leaves and toads were added to
increase the flavor. The Nicaraguans make their favorite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
drink from a wild red cherry. It takes several weeks
to prepare these liquors, but by the generous aid of
friends the stock is often consumed at one carousal.<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CUSTOMS IN GUATEMALA AND NICARAGUA.</p>

<p>Ignorant and oppressed as they are, superstition is
naturally strong among them, the evil eye, ominous import
of animals and the like being firmly believed in.
Nicaraguans gave as a reason for speaking in whispers
at night, that loud talking attracts mosquitos.
The Quichés, of Istlávacan, among others, believe in
certain evil and certain good days, and arrange their
undertakings accordingly. When meeting a stranger,
they present the forehead to be touched, thinking that
a beneficial power is imparted to them by this means.
They still adhere to their sorcerers, who are called in
upon all important occasions, to predict the future, exorcise
evil spirits and the like, with the aid of various
decoctions and incantations. The Chontales have diviners
who, with the aid of drugs, taken after a fast, fall into
a trance, during which they prophesy. They form a
sort of guild, and live alone in the mountains with a
few pupils, who support them in return for the instruction
received. Although idolatry proper is abolished,
some ancient practices still live, blended with their
Christian worship, and it is said that tribes inhabiting
the remote mountain regions still keep up their old rites
in secret. Dollfus is apparently inclined to believe that
the songs he heard the natives chant every morning and
evening may be the relic of some ancient religious ceremony.
The Itzas hold deer sacred, and these animals
were consequently quite familiar with man, before the
conquerors subdued the country. The Lacandones are
said to have been the last who publicly worshiped in their

temple, and whose priests sacrificed animals to idols.
By the side of the temple stood two other large buildings
used as meeting-houses, one for men, the other for
women. Dogs and tame parrots formed part of their
domestic establishment. The native is very taciturn
before strangers, but on paying a visit to friends he will
deliver long harangues full of repetition. It is almost
impossible to obtain a direct answer from him to any
question. Another peculiarity with many is to hoard
money at the expense of bodily comfort. It is buried
in some secret place, and the owner dies without even
caring to inform his kin of the whereabouts of his
treasures. The favorite occupation of the people is
to act as porters, and Guatemala certainly possesses
the most excellent carriers, who are trained for the
business from an early age. They usually go in files,
headed by a chief, all armed with long staffs and water-proof
palm-leaf mats, and travel from twenty to thirty
miles a day, for days in succession, without suffering any
inconvenience. The weight varies from one hundred
to two hundred and fifty pounds, according to road and
distance, and is carried on the back, supported by straps
passed over the forehead and shoulders. They are very
moderate in eating, and never drink cold water if they
can avoid it; when tired, they stretch themselves at
full length on the ground, and are speedily refreshed.
Women are also accustomed to carry burdens, and may
frequently be seen taking several filled pitchers to market
in nets suspended from their forehead and shoulders.
Water they usually bring in jars balanced on the head.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL PRACTICE.</p>

<p>The ruling diseases are small-pox, which makes yearly
havoc; dysentery, which is also not uncommon in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
highlands during the summer; and leprosy, manifested
by wounds and eruptions, and caused by filth, immoral
habits, and bad food. In some parts of Nicaragua, the
latter disease breaks out in horny excrescences, similar
in appearance to the tips of cow-horns. Rheumatism
and chest diseases are rare, in spite of their rough life.
Superstitious practices and empirical recipes transmitted
from their ancestors are the remedies resorted to. Hot
bathing is the favorite treatment. They are skillful at
blood-letting, making very small punctures, and applying
a pinch of salt to them after the operation is ended.
Cauterizing wounds to prevent inflammation is not uncommon,
and does not affect the patient much. The
principal remedy of the Chorotegans consists of a decoction
from various herbs injected by means of a tube.
Some tribes of the highlands call in sorcerers to knead
and suck the suffering part. After performing a variety
of antics and grimaces, the wise man produces a black
substance from the mouth, which he announces as the
cause of the sickness; the friends of the patient take
this matter and trample it to pieces amidst noisy demonstrations.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p>Their dead are washed, and dressed in a fresh suit;
friends then assemble to express their regard and sorrow
by burning copal and performing a wild dance round the
corpse, which is buried with all its belongings, as well
as food for sustenance on the long journey. The Itzas,
inhabiting the islands in the lake Peten, are said to have
thrown their dead into the lake, for want of room.<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a></p>

<p>The character of the Guatemalans exhibits a number
of excellent traits. They have always been a gentle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
race, and easily led by kindness, but centuries of oppression
have thrown over them a timid, brooding spirit.
Far from warlike, they have nevertheless proved themselves
efficient soldiers during the late civil wars. Their
honesty and faithfulness to a trust or engagement is universally
admitted, and every traveler bears witness to
their hospitality and obliging disposition. Although
taciturn before strangers, whom they naturally distrust,
they are quite voluble and merry among themselves,
especially the women; their mirth, however, wants the
ring of true happiness. Looking at the darker side,
it is found that drunkenness stands preëminent, and
if the native is not oftener drunk, it is because the
means for carousing are wanting. Surrounded by a
bountiful nature, he is naturally lazy and improvident,
whole days being passed in dreamy inaction, without a
symptom of ennui. He is obstinate, and clings to ancient
customs, yet he will not dispute with you, but tacitly
forms his own opinion. Taught to be humble, he does
not possess much manliness, has a certain cunning, will
weep at trifles, and is apt to be vindictive, especially if
his jealousy is aroused. The highlanders form an exception
to these general characteristics in many respects.
The purer air of the mountain has infused in them a
certain independent energy, and industry. Nor are the
women to be classed as lazy, for their position is rather
that of slaves than of wives, yet they are vivacious and
not devoid of coquetry, but of undisputed modesty.
Many of the remoter tribes are brave, and the Manches,
for instance, behaved lately in so spirited a manner as
to compel the government to treat with them. The
Itzas are said to have been warlike and cruel, but their
neighbors the Lacandones are not so ferocious as supposed.
The Quichés bear a high character for industry,
and intelligence, while those of Rabinal excel in
truthfulness, honesty, and morality. The Vera Paz
tribes are less active and industrious than those of
the plateau; this applies especially to the eastern
nations who are also more stupid than the western.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
The Salvador people are noted for their phlegmatic
temperament, and the provoked stranger who seeks
to hurry them, is merely laughed at; otherwise they,
as well as the Nicaraguans, are more docile and industrious
than the Guatemalans, but also more superstitious.
Scherzer thinks that they have all the inclination for
becoming robbers, but want the energy. The Aztec remnants
in Nicaragua are particularly patient and thrifty,
but extremely shy and brooding. The Chontales, on
the other hand, are said to have been a savage and debased
race, while the Cholutecs were brave and cruel
but subject to petticoat rule. Opinions concerning the
intelligence of the natives and their prospect of advancement
are varied, some affirming that they are dull
and spiritless, incapable of making any progress, while
others assign them a high character and intelligence,
which, properly directed, would give them a prominent
position.<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MOSQUITOS.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Mosquitos</span>, the second division of the Central
American group, are at the present day composed in
part of an incongruous mixture of Carib colonists and
negro importations, and in part of a pure native element.
Owing to the independent spirit of the tribes along the
central chain of mountains, which successfully resisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
the attempts of Spaniards to penetrate the territory, and
to the unhealthy climate of the coast, this country, with
the exception of the northern part of Honduras, has as
yet escaped subjection to the white race. The country,
aside from the sea-shore, possesses many attractive
features. The transverse ranges, radiating from the
principal chain, form a series of terraces which gradually
lessen in elevation, until they disappear in a low coast
region. Between them innumerable rivers, fed by the
moisture-laden sea-winds, now rushing boisterously from
heavily wooded heights, now sluggishly wending their
way through luxuriant prairie-land, flow through a region
of most pleasing variety, and at last empty into vast
lagoons bordering the ocean. The aborigines still form
the greater part of the population, and are composed of
a large number of tribes which, while practicing agriculture
to a limited extent, subsist chiefly on natural
fruits and on the products of the chase. Excepting the
small tribes of the eastern Mosquito country, Mr Squier,
who has given much patient research to their languages,
includes the natives of this sub-division among
<span class="sidenote">MOSQUITO NATIONS.</span>
the Lenca family, at the head of which stand the <i>Guajiqueros</i>
in western Honduras, essentially an agricultural
people. East of these are the <i>Xicaques</i>, and <i>Poyas</i>,
names given to a collection of closely related tribes,
some of which have been brought under the subjugating
influences of the missionary Fathers, while others
still keep their ancient customs intact. The <i>Secos</i> on
Black River are included by some writers with the
Poyas. South and west of these are the <i>Moscos</i>, and in
the western part of the Mosquito coast, the <i>Woolwas</i>,
who still cherish a tradition of their emigration from
the north-west. East of the latter live the <i>Towkas</i> and
<i>Cookras</i>, who extend to Blewfields, and speak dialects
varying little from the Woolwa tongue, but stand lower
in the scale of humanity. Bell states that the Towkas
are merely a branch of the <i>Smoos</i>, who have many points
in common with the Poyas, though differing from them
in language. Among other aborigines may be mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
the <i>Albatuinas</i>, <i>Tahuas</i>, <i>Panamekas</i>, <i>Jaras</i>, <i>Taos</i>,
<i>Gaulas</i>, <i>Itziles</i>, <i>Motucas</i>, and the <i>Ramas</i> on the Blewfields
lagoon; of several others the names are either lost
or unknown. Following the coast southward we meet
the <i>Caribs</i>, a strong, hardy, but crude race at present,
of varied negro admixture, chiefly descended from the
turbulent natives of San Vicente island, whom the English
transported in 1796 to the island of Roatan, whence
they were brought over to Honduras. The Caribs, who
have within a few decades spread from a small colony
over the whole northern coast, driving other nations into
the interior and southward, appear to be superseding
the aborigines, now fast disappearing under the annihilating
effect of drink and disease. South of the
Caribs round cape Gracias á Dios are the <i>Sambos</i>, or
<i>Mosquitos</i> proper, said to have sprung from the union of
native women with negro slaves wrecked on the coast
during the seventeenth century. Owing to their geographical
position they were brought in contact with the
buccaneers, and placed in a position to gain ascendancy
over other tribes from the Poyas southward, but were
at the same time inoculated with the degrading vices
and disorders which are now so rapidly bringing about
their extinction. Elated by their position as masters of
the coast, they assumed the proud title of <i>Waiknas</i>, or
men, in which conceit they have been imitated by the
subjected tribes, which are gradually adopting the Sambo
tongue. Adjacent to them are the <i>Toonglas</i>, a not very
numerous offshoot of Smoos and Sambos.<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span></p>

<p>Race-mixtures in certain localities have almost obliterated
aboriginal types, which are portrayed as of medium
stature, regular form, and varying in color from light
brown to dark coppery. The people about cape Gracias
á Dios are represented by the first voyagers to have been
nearly as dark as negroes. The face is rather flat and
oval, the head smaller than among Europeans; forehead
high and cheek-bones not very prominent; hair long,
straight, coarse, and black; beard scanty; nose very
small, thin, and usually aquiline among the coast people,
but larger and broader toward the interior. The
iris of the eye is generally black, but often verges
toward brown; mouth broad, with thin lips and regular
teeth. The women present a full bust and abdomen;
they are called pretty, but early marriages soon make
them old. It is suspected that infant murder has
something to do with the rarity of deformed people.
The Towkas and Ramas present the finest pure-blooded
type, the former being very fair, while the latter are
large, athletic, and stern-looking. The Poyas are copper-colored,
short, but muscular, broad-faced, with large
forehead, bent nose, and small, mild eyes. The Toonglas
are duskier; the Smoos approach the fair Towkas
in hue, though they have a flatter head, accompanied
by a stolid look. The darkest of all are the Woolwas,
whose color seems a mixture of yellow ochre and
India ink. Proceeding to Honduras, we meet the
Caribs, whose varied admixture of negro blood separates
them into yellow and black Caribs. The former
are distinguished by a somewhat ruddy hue, with a
hooked nose; while his duskier brother is taller, hardier,
and longer-lived; with a nose inclining to aquiline.
Children are prettier as they approach the negro type.
The hair varies in curl and gloss according to purity
of blood. The Mosquitos proper are more uniform in
appearance, and buccaneers have no doubt assisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
in bringing out many of the characteristics that have
obtained for the Sambo race the leading position on
the coast. They are all well-built, raw-boned, nimble,
and of a dull, dark, copper color. The face is oval, with
a coarse, lustful expression, the hair rough, wavy, and
black, eyes bright and remarkably strong; women pretty,
with large eyes, and small feet and ankles.<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO PHYSIQUE AND DRESS.</p>

<p>A piece of cloth fastened at the waist in a twist or by
a cord, and reaching to the knee, constitutes the native
male costume in these parts, that of the women being
somewhat shorter. This cloth is either of cotton, sometimes
woven with down, or of fibres from the inner bark
of the caoutchouc tree, beaten on stones till they become
soft, and is often large enough to serve for a covering at
night. Some are quite fanciful in color and design, and
formerly they were painted. Those of the Woolwas are
usually six feet long by three broad, striped blue and
yellow; they are passed between the legs and fastened at
the waist by a thong. The Xicaques, on the contrary,
wear the cloth serape-fashion, by passing the head
through a slit in the centre, and tying the folds round
the waist. Even this scanty covering is often reduced
to the smallest apron, and is dispensed with altogether
in some parts, for modern travelers speak of natives
in a naked state. Women occasionally wear a small
square cloth, having an opening for the head, one part
of which covers the breast, the other the back. In
some parts chiefs are distinguished by a cotton cap,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span>
and a long sleeveless robe, open in front and often nicely
ornamented; in other places men of rank wear turbans
decorated with plumes and feathers, and dress in skins
of eagles, tigers, and other animals; these are also used
by the common people on festive occasions. The Smoos'
head-dress is especially pretty, with its embroidery and
feather-work. Ordinarily the long loose hair is deemed
sufficient to protect the head, and is kept sleek and shining
by palm-oil, which they say furthers its growth.
The women have longer hair than the men, and often
dress it in ringlets, seldom in a knot or wreath. The
people of northern Honduras wear a lock hanging over
the forehead; some highland chieftains, on the contrary,
shave the front of the head, but allow the back hair to
grow long, while the Poyas part theirs in the middle,
keeping it in position with a band. That of the religious
men reaches to the waist, and generally falls in braids
behind. In mourning, both sides of the head are shaved,
a bushy comb being left along the middle. Formerly
all hair except that on the head, even eyebrows
and lashes, was pulled out, because it was thought fit for
animals only to have hair on the body. All go barefooted,
and it is only where the native has to travel
over a rough road that he puts on <i>alparagats</i>, or sandals
of bark, wood, or skin, which are fastened by thongs
round the foot. Whatever is wanting in actual dress,
however, is made up by paint and ornaments, of which
both sexes are equally fond. The face and upper part
of the body are either uniformly daubed over or tattooed
with rays, fanciful lines, and designs representing animals
and the like, chiefly in red and black. Taste is not
wanting in this adornment, for the tint is often delicate,
and the black circles round the eyes indicate that they
understand effect, increasing as they do the lustre of the
orbs. Esquemelin states that when visitors were expected,
the men combed the hair, and smeared the face
with an ointment of oil and black powder, the women
using a red admixture. Tattooing figures on the body
by cauterization, as seen by Columbus on the Mosquito
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
Coast, is still practiced in certain parts of the interior.
Aboriginal Mosquitos also perforated ears, lips, and
cheeks, to hold pendants of fish-bones and green stones;
the holes in the ears being as large as eggs. The natives of
Corn island not only carried large pieces of wood in the
ears, but gradually enlarged the hole in the lower lip;
at fifteen years of age the wood was removed and a tortoise-shell
inserted. Women wore a tight bandage round
the ankle to increase the size of their calves. Strings
of tastefully arranged beads, bones, shells, and stones,
and gaily colored bandages, were worn round the neck
and wrist; the women adorning the legs and ankles in
a similar manner, and also using feathers and flowers.
Certain interior tribes, as the Smoos, esteem a round
<span class="sidenote">MOSQUITO HEAD-FLATTENING.</span>
forehead as a reproach, and hence the head is flattened,
the effect of which would be more noticeable, were it
not for the thick bushy hair. This head-flattening
fashion here appears for the first time since we left the
Columbian group; we shall see it once again further
south, and that is all. The process here is essentially
similar to that of the Columbians. When the infant is
a month old, it is tied to a board, and a flat piece of
wood, kept firm by bands, is placed upon the forehead.
The child remains in this painful position for several
months, the pressure increasing as the head grows.<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>Towns there are none, except in certain parts; seldom
do more than four or five houses stand in a group; the
locality being changed at intervals for sanitary or superstitious
purposes. A few upright posts planted in parallel
lines, or in a circle, and occasionally interwoven
with cane or leaves, support what may be called the hut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">718</a></span>
proper, which is a sharply sloping, well-thatched palm-leaf
roof with projecting eaves, reaching to within three
or four feet of the ground. There is usually but one
apartment, the floor of which is often coated with clay,
and raised a little to avoid dampness. In the center is
the fireplace, surrounded by household ware and cackling
hens, and all round may be seen hammocks and nets
suspended from the bamboo rafters. Some sleep on a
frame-work of bamboo placed upon posts. The better class
of houses contain partitions for the several families occupying
it, and stand in fields enclosed by stalk fences. A
village with many of the interior tribes consists of one large
building, often one hundred feet long by thirty feet wide.
The front and end of these structures are open, but the
back is partitioned off into small closets with the bark of
the cabbage-palms, each serving as a bedroom for a married
couple, or for unmarried women. A platform immediately
under the roof is used as a sleeping-place for the
boys, and an apartment at the end of the hut is set apart
for women about to be confined. Some of the Guajiquero
villages contain over a hundred substantial huts of
mud, or of cane plastered over and whitewashed. The
Toonglas and Cookras, erect temporary sheds near the
streams, during the summer, but seek more secure huts
in the winter. Carib dwellings are the neatest of all;
some are of cane, others of frame-work filled with mud.
Cockburn relates that, during his journey through Honduras,
he came across a bridge made of a net-work of
cane, which was suspended between trees so that the
centre hung forty feet above the surface of the stream.
He found it very old and shaky, and concluded that it
belonged to the remote past.<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD IN HONDURAS.</p>

<p>Redundant nature here leaves man so little to do,
as scarcely to afford an opportunity for development.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">719</a></span>
The people of northern Honduras, according to Herrera,
cleared the ground with stone axes, and turned the sod
by main strength with a forked pole or with sharp wooden
spades, and by this means secured two or three yields every
year; but the present occupants scarcely take so much
trouble. On marrying, the men prepare a small field
for a few beds of yams, beans, cassava, and squash, some
pepper, and pine-apples, besides twenty to thirty plantain
and cocoa-nut trees, leaving their wives to give it
such further care as may be required. Where maize is
cultivated it is either sown two or three grains in holes
two feet apart, or broadcast over freshly cleared woodland
a little before the rainy season. The Poyas are
the only people who cultivate respectable farms. Fishing
is the favorite occupation of the coast tribes, and
their dexterity with the spear and harpoon is quite remarkable.
The proper time for catching the larger
species of fish, such as the tarpom and palpa, is at night,
when a fleet of pitpans, each with a pitch-pine torch in
the bow, may be seen on the lagoon intermingling in
picturesque confusion. One or two paddlers propel the
boat, another holds the torch, while the harpooneer stands
at the bow with a <i>waisko-dusa</i>, or staff, having a loosely
fitting, barbed harpoon at one end, and a piece of light
wood at the other. A short line attached to the harpoon,
passes along the staff, and is rolled round this float for
convenience. The glare of the torch attracts the fish
and enables the bowman to spy his prey, which is immediately
transfixed by the harpoon. Away it darts, but
the float retards its progress, and points out its whereabouts
to the boatmen, who again seize the line, and
drag it to the shore. Occasionally the tarpom is taken
in strong nets, the meshes of which require to be six
inches square in order to entangle it. Manatees or sea-cows
are caught in the early morning, and to get within
striking distance of the wary animal, it is necessary to
deck the canoe with bushes and leaves, giving it the appearance
of a floating tree. The line attached to the
harpoon is in this case payed out from the canoe, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">720</a></span>
is often trailed by the manatee in a lively manner. It
generally takes several harpoons as well as lances to kill
it. Smaller harpoons, without barb, with merely quadrangular
points an inch and a half long and nearly as
wide, are used for catching turtles so that the shell may
not be damaged. As the canoe approaches, the turtle
slides under the water; the bowman signalizes the oarsman
how to steer, and when the turtle rises to breathe,
it is speared, dragged into the canoes, and placed on its
back. Some fishermen will jump into the water after
the animal, and bring it up in their hands, but this
feat is attended with danger, from bites and sharp
coral. The hawk-bill turtle is set free after the shell
has been stripped of its scales, but the green species
is eaten, and its eggs, which are esteemed a dainty,
are sought for in the sand by poking suspected places
with a stick. Smaller fish are speared with the <i>sinnock</i>,
a long pole with a fixed point. The river people
take less pleasure in fishing, and resort thereto only
as driven by necessity. Weirs of branches and clay
are constructed, with a small outlet in the middle,
where men are stationed to catch the passing fish
with nets and spears. The Poyas employ a still surer
method. The water is beaten with sticks for some distance
above the weir, so as to drive the fish together; a
quantity of juice extracted from a wild vine called
<i>pequine</i>, which has a stupefying effect, is thrown into the
water, and the men have merely to select the best looking,
the smaller ones being allowed to float away and
recover in the unadulterated waters below. The preserving
of fish is the work of women, who cut them in slices,&mdash;sometimes
rubbing them with salt,&mdash;and place the pieces
on a framework of cane over the fire to be smoke-dried;
after which they are exposed to the sun for a day or two.
Part of the fish is cooked, or baked in oil, and eaten at
<span class="sidenote">MOSQUITO COOKERY.</span>
once. If we except the Smoos and Xicaques, who follow
game with true precision and patience, the usual
mode of hunting is as primitive as weir-fishing. A
number of men assemble and set fire to the grass, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">721</a></span>
drives the terrified animals into a corner, where they
are shot or struck down, or the game is entrapped in
holes partly filled with water. The wild hog, the tapir,
and deer supply most of the meat, which is cured in the
same way as fish: some cutting the meat in strips, and
curing it on the <i>buccan</i>, or grate of sticks, while others
prefer the barbecue method which is to smoke-dry the
whole animal. Certain old writers state that human
flesh was eaten, but this is discredited by others, who
think that the error arose from seeing the natives feast
on monkeys, which, skinned, have much the appearance
of humans. The statement of their eating raw
fish may also be wrong, for the natives of the present
day are very careful about thoroughly cooking their food,
and even avoid fruit not fully ripened. A well-known
article of food is the Carib bread, a sort of white hard
biscuit made from cassava or mandioc roots, which are
skinned, washed, and grated on a board set with sharp
stones. The pulp is rinsed in water to extract the
poisonous juice, and when it is sufficiently whitened by
this means, the water is carefully pressed out, and the
substance set to dry in the sun. The sifted flour
is made into large round thin cakes, which, after
being exposed to the sun for a while, are slowly
baked over the fire. The Poyas make large rolls, which
are wrapped in leaves and baked in the ashes. These
soon become sour, and are then eaten with a relish.
Others grind cassava or maize on the metate, and bake
tortillas. A gruel is also made of the flour, and eaten
with salt and chile, or syrup. One of their dainties is
<i>bisbire</i>, the name given to plantains kept in leaves till
putrid, and eaten boiled. Scalding hot cacao mixed
with chile is the favorite stimulant, of which large quantities
are imbibed, until the perspiration starts from every
pore. Cacao-fruit is also eaten roasted. Notwithstanding
the richness of the soil and the variety of its productions,
the natives are accused of resorting to insects
for food, and of eating their own vermin. The coast
people have the greater selection, but trust mostly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">722</a></span>
fishing, while the interior tribes after natural products
depend upon the chase. The Cookras subsist chiefly on
the cabbage-palm. Sambo girls have a peculiar fancy
for eating charcoal and sand, believing that their charms
are improved thereby. No regularity is observed in
eating, but food is taken at any hour, and with voracity;
nor will they take the trouble to procure more, until the
whole stock is consumed, and hunger drives them from
their hammocks. The Poyas and Guajiqueros seem to be
the only tribes who have any idea of providing for the
future; the latter laying up a common reserve.<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a></p>

<p>Frequent bathing is the rule, yet the Sambos, who
have a better opportunity for this, perhaps, than other
tribes, are described as dirty in their surroundings, and,
when warmed by motion, emit a disagreeable odor,
arising from the use of ointments and powders. The
Poyas, Xicaques, Secos, and especially the Caribs are,
on the contrary, very cleanly in their habits.<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO WEAPONS AND WAR.</p>

<p>The bow and arrow figures as the chief weapon of
the Mosquitos, the former being usually of iron-wood,
spanned with twisted mahoe-bark, and often six feet in
length; the latter of reed or wood, hardened in fire,
and pointed with hard wood, flint, fish-bones, or teeth.
They not only handle the bow well, but some are expert
in the art of defense. To attain this dexterity,
children are taught to turn aside, with a stick, the blunt
darts thrown at them, and in time they become sufficiently
expert to ward off arrows in the same manner.
They also fight with cane lances about nine feet long,
with oblong diamond points, javelins, clubs, and heavy
sharp-pointed swords made of a poisonous wood, a
splinter from which causes first madness and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">723</a></span>
death. The milky juice of the manzanilla-tree is used
to poison arrows and darts. Blowpipes, whose light
arrows surely and silently bring down birds at a hundred
feet and over, are in great favor with the youth. Armor
is made of plaited reeds covered with tiger-skins, and
ornamented with feathers; besides which, the northern
Mosquitos employ a breastplate of twisted cotton, like
that of the Mexicans. Mosquito women are said to be
as good archers as the men.<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a></p>

<p>Aboriginal wars were continually waged in Honduras
without any other object than to avenge the death
of an ancestor, or to retaliate on those who had carried
away friends into slavery. Neighboring tribes, however,
agreed to a truce at certain times, to allow the
interchange of goods. Previous to starting on an expedition,
turkeys, dogs, and even human beings were
sacrificed to influence the gods; blood was drawn from
tongue and ears, and dreams carefully noted, and their
import determined. Ambassadors were sent to challenge
the enemy to a pitched battle, and, if they were not responded
to, the country was ravaged. When prisoners were
taken they were usually held as slaves, after having the
nose cut off. Forty thousand men sometimes composed
an expedition, operating without chief or order, devising
ambushes and stratagems as it suited them, and accompanied
by women to act as porters. Mosquito warriors
blacken the face, and place themselves under the temporary
command of the bravest and most experienced.
The coast people are bold and unyielding, and usually
kill their prisoners. When the Sambos confederate with
their neighbors, they expect their allies to pay for friends
lost in battle.<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">724</a></span></p>

<p>Domestic utensils in the homes of the Mosquitos consist
of stones for grinding grain and roots, clay pots and
plates for cooking purposes, and gourds, calabashes, and
nets for holding food and liquids. The stone hatchet,
which is fast becoming a relic, is ten inches long, four
broad, and three thick, sharp at both ends, with a
groove to hold the handle which is firmly twisted round
its centre. Besides the implements already referred to
under fishing and weapons, may be mentioned the lasso,
in the use of which they are very expert, and the <i>patapee</i>,
a pretty water-tight basket that the Caribs plait of
reeds. The men usually sleep in hammocks, or on mats
spread on the ground near the fire, with a stick for a
pillow, while the women prefer a platform of cane raised
a few feet from the ground, and covered with a mat or
a skin.<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<p>Fibres of mahoe and ule bark, pisang-leaves and silk-grass
furnish material for ropes, nets, mats, and coarse
fabrics. Most of the Mosquitos grow a little cotton,
which the women spin on a rude wheel, like that of the
Guatemalans, and weave on a frame loom into strong
and neat cloths. The favorite blue color for dyeing is
obtained from the <i>jiquilite</i> plant; the yellow from the
<i>achiolt</i> tree. Pottery is a very ancient art among them,
as may be seen from the fine specimens discovered in
the graves and ruins of Honduras. Their red cooking-pots
are very light but strong, and the water-jars, which
are only slightly burnt to permit percolation, show considerable
taste in design.<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BOATS AND FISHERIES.</p>

<p>Nowhere do we find more daring and expert boatmen
than the Mosquitos, who will venture out upon the
roughest sea in a boat barely large enough to hold a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">725</a></span>
and a boy. If the boat capsize it is at once righted,
bailed out, and the voyage resumed, and seldom is any
part of the cargo lost. The <i>dory</i>, or ordinary sea-boat
is a hollowed-out tree, often twenty-five to fifty feet long,
four to six wide, and four to five deep, round-bottomed,
buoyant, and with good handling safe. The best are
made by the up-river tribes, especially the Towkas, who
prepare them roughly with axe and fire, and sell them
to the coast people to be finished according to fancy.
After the dug-out has been trimmed, it is often soaked
in water for a time, so that the sides may be stretched
and secured with knees. The <i>pitpan</i>, which is used on
rivers and lagoons, differs from the dory in being flat-bottomed,
with broad and gradually rounded ends, and
of less depth and width. Cedar is chiefly used for pitpans
on account of its lightness, and the stronger mahogany
for dories; but the latter are, however, soon injured
by worms if kept in the water. Small boats are propelled
by a single broad-bladed paddle; sails also are
employed with the <i>crean</i> or keeled canoe.<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>Harpoon and canoe are the basis of the Mosquito's
wealth, for with them he obtains his food and the tortoise-shell,
the principal article of traffic. The season for
catching hawk-bill turtles is from April to August, when
fleets of canoes, each manned by about twelve men, proceed
to different parts of the coast, as far south as Chiriquí,
and bring home ten thousand pounds of shell on an
average. Green turtles, which are caught near reefs,
also find a good market in Blewfields and elsewhere.
All keep hogs, the Caribs more than others; many possess
cattle and horses, which are allowed to run wild
over the prairies, the horses being lassoed whenever
required for riding. Their manner of breaking them is
unique. One man leads the horse with the lasso into
water, to a depth of three or four feet, when another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">726</a></span>
jumps upon his back, and responds to buckings and skittishness
with blows on the head, until in about half an
hour the exhausted animal surrenders. A line of bark-fibre
serves for reins, and a few plaited palm-leaves for
saddle. Preservation of wealth is little thought of, for
cattle are most recklessly slaughtered at feasts and for
offences, and fruit-trees, as well as other property are,
as a rule, destroyed on the death of the owner. Quite
a trade is carried on in these parts, the inland tribes
bringing rough canoes, calabashes, skins, cloth, honey,
and cacao to the coast people, and receiving therefor turtles,
salt, English fancy and useful articles; while many
of the latter undertake lengthy coast trips to dispose of
the bartered produce, as well as their own. The Wankees
deal heavily in <i>bisbire</i>, or decomposed plantains,
while sarsaparilla and honey are the staple articles of
the Secos and Poyas. A mixture of shrewdness and
simplicity characterizes their dealings. A party wishing
to dispose of hides, for instance, first produces the worst
ones, which are thrown aside by the buyer until those
of the standard quality are brought out; a sum is then
offered for the whole, which is often unhesitatingly accepted
by the native who is too dazzled by the apparently
high price to consider the amount of produce given for
it. Very little value is placed upon labor, for canoes,
which have taken a considerable time to prepare, are
often bartered for a mere trifle. The people of Honduras
have always a stock of cloth and honey to pay taxes
with, and set a high value on colored feathers obtained
from Yucatec coast traders, who take cacao for return
cargoes.<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO CALENDAR AND ART.</p>

<p>Although versatile enough in handicrafts, their mental
faculties are exceedingly crude. With the aid of
fingers and toes the Sambo is able to count to twenty,
but anything beyond that confuses him. Time is reckoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">727</a></span>
by <i>kates</i>, or moons, thirteen of which make a <i>mani</i>,
or year. When asked to fix the date of an event, he
will say that it occurred so many sleeps or moons ago;
but when the time exceeds a year or two, the answer is
given in the rather indefinite term of "many, many
years;" consequently he is unable to tell his age. His
ideas of cosmology are equally vague; thus, stars are
held to be glowing stones. The people of Honduras call
the year <i>iolar</i>, and divide it in the same manner as the
Mexicans, by whom the system has, no doubt, been introduced.
They reckon time by so many nights or twilights,
not by days, and determine the hour by the
height of the sun. The song-language of the Mosquitos
differs greatly from that employed in conversation, a
quaint old-time style being apparently preserved in their
lyrics.<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p>The art of extracting and melting gold has long been
known to them, but, although they wear a few ornaments
of this metal, they do not seem to prize it very
highly. At the time of Cockburn's visit to Honduras,
dams were used in mining, and instruments of cane to
sift the gold. The mode employed by the Poyas to
separate gold from sand is the one known in California
as panning, and is thus described by Squier: "Scooping
up some of the sand in his bowl, and then filling it with
water, he whirled it rapidly, so that a feathery stream
of mingled sand and water flew constantly over its edge.
He continued this operation until the sand was nearly
exhausted, and then filled the bowl again. After repeating
this process several times, he grew more careful,
balancing the bowl skillfully, and stopping occasionally
to pick out the pebbles ... after the process was complete,
the Poyer showed me a little deposit of gold, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">728</a></span>
grains, at the bottom of the calabash." The gold dust
passes into the hands of the white trader.<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT, SLAVERY, POLYGAMY.</p>

<p>The Mosquitos proper are ruled by a hereditary king,
who claims sovereignty over the interior tribes of the
Mosquito Coast, which, in many cases, is merely nominal.
Before the English made their influence felt, this
monarch, who, in these latter degenerate days, does not
possess many prerogatives, seems to have had but a small
extent of territory, for among the earlier travelers some
assert that the inhabitants of this coast lived under a
republican rule, while others observed no form of government.
Each village or community has a principal
man, or judge, selected from the eldest and ablest, who
settles minor grievances, referring weightier matters to
the king, and superintends the contribution of canoes,
tortoise-shells, and produce for the support of the monarch
and chiefs&mdash;for regular taxes are not collected.
Among the Poyas, the old men, who are highly respected
by their juniors, assemble every evening to
deliberate upon the duties of the following day; all
members of the tribe take part in the work, and share
alike in the results. According to Young, the Mosquitos
had an officer, in whom was vested certain
authority. The Caribs are also ruled by elders, dignified
by the title of captains. Their laws are in some
respects harsh: for instance, a woman who has had intercourse
with a man of another race is whipped slowly
to death. Sambos are less particular in this matter,
the adulterer being merely mulcted in a cow. If the
decision of a chief be not satisfactory, the contestants
resort to trial by combat. The Xicaques live in communities
of from seventy to one hundred persons ruled
by chiefs elected for life. The insignia of a judge or
ruler in Honduras are a white staff, often elaborately
ornamented with a golden head and tassels. Formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">729</a></span>
each town or province was ruled by an hereditary cacique,
who administered justice with four nobles as counselors.
Theft was punished by confiscation of property, and in
graver cases the ears and hands of the culprit were
cut off; the adulterer caught in the act had his ear-rings
forcibly torn out; then he was whipped by the relatives
of the injured, and deprived of his possessions. The
woman went free on the supposition that she, as the
weaker party, was not responsible.<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p>One principal object of war among the ancient nations
of Honduras was to make slaves, but the Mosquito
Coast was free from this scourge, according to all
accounts.<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO MARRIAGE CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>Polygamy obtains, some men having six wives each,
and the king yet more. The first wife, who as a rule,
is betrothed from early infancy, is mistress commanding;
her marriage is attended with festivities, and later
additions to the harem are subject to her. The custom
is to marry early, often before puberty, and it is not unusual
to see a girl of thirteen with an offspring in her
arms; but the marriage tie is not very binding, for the
wife may be discarded or sold at will, on the slightest
pretence, especially if children do not follow the
union. The interior tribes, which are less given to plurality
of wives, bear a pretty good character for female
<span class="sidenote">MOSQUITO COURTSHIP.</span>
chastity. The cacique of ancient Honduras married
among his own class. On behalf of a suitor not previously
engaged, an old man was dispatched with
presents to the father of the chosen girl, before whom
he made a long harangue on the ancestry and qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">730</a></span>
of the youth. If this proved satisfactory, the presents
were accepted, and Bacchanalia followed. Next
morning the bride was closely wrapped in a gorgeously
painted cloth, and, seated upon the shoulder of a man,
was conveyed to the bridegroom, a number of friends
accompanying her, dancing and singing along the road,
drinking out of every rivulet, and feasting at every
stopping-place. On arrival, she was received by the
female friends of the groom, and subjected to a cleaning
and perfuming process, lasting three days, during which
the friends of the two families held a grand feast to
celebrate the approaching union. She was then delivered
to the husband, who kept her three nights at his
home, and then proceeded to the house of his father-in-law,
where the couple remained three other nights, after
which they returned to their own house and renewed
festivities. These were the ceremonies attending the marriage
of nobles only. An old woman acted as messenger
for common swains, and brought a present of cacao to
the bride's parents, which was consumed at the preliminary
feast. The girl was then delivered to the old
woman, together with a return present of cacao to serve
for two feasts, one taking place at the house of the
bridegroom, the other at the bride's. Relationship was
no impediment to marriage, and widows were received
among the wives of the late husband's brother. Immorality
ruled, and the most lascivious performances
prevailed at their festivals. On the islands in the
gulf of Honduras and on the Belize coast, the suitor had
to undergo a preliminary examination by the proposed
father-in-law as to his ability to perform the duties of
husband; if satisfactory, a bow and arrow were handed
him, and he at once presented himself before the object
of his affection with a garland of leaves and
flowers, which she placed upon her head instead of
the wreath always worn by a virgin. Friends thereupon
met at the home of the bride to discuss the
prospects of the couple, and to witness the act of giving
her to the bridegroom, partaking, meanwhile, of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">731</a></span>
cheering liquid. The next day the bride appeared before
the mother, and tore off her garland with much
lamentation. Among the Sambos the betrothed suitor
must give presents of food and other articles to the
parents of his intended, as payment for their care of
her until she attains the marriageable age, when he
comes to claim her. Should the parents then refuse to
give up the girl, they are bound to refund the value of
the presents twice or thrice told. The usual price paid
for a wife is a cow or its equivalent, which is also
exacted from any man infringing on the marital right,
while the female for such offence is merely beaten.
Esquemelin adds that when the young man came to
claim his bride, he was questioned as to his ability to
make nets and arrows, and if all went well, the daughter
was summoned to bring a calabash of wine, which the
three drained between them in token of the new relationship.
The widow was bound to supply the grave
of her husband with provisions for a year, after which
she took up the bones and carried them with her for
another year, at last placing them upon the roof of her
house, and then only was she allowed to marry again.
The Carib must provide a separate house and field for
each of his wives, where she not only supports herself,
her children, and her husband, but can, if she
pleases, accumulate property. The husband is expected
to spend his time equally between his wives, but not to
assist in providing necessities after the marriage day;
should his help be required, the wife must pay him the
customary rate of wages. The several wives compete
jealously with each other to provide the best for their
husband, and are comparatively well-behaved, owing,
perhaps, to the severe punishment of infidelity. Among
the Smoos, wives of one husband generally live together,
each wife bringing her share to make up her lord's
dinner. Widows are the property of the relatives of
the husband, to whom 'widow-money' must be paid
before they are allowed to marry again. The method
of courtship among the Woolwas is to place a deer's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">732</a></span>
carcass and some firewood at the door of the intended;
if accepted, marriage ensues. Each wife has usually
a separate establishment. The Towkas, who are more
inclined to monogamy, have an interesting marriage
ceremony, of which Squier gives a long account. On
the betrothal of children a corresponding cotton band
is fastened above the elbow or below the knee of
each. These bands are selected by the old men so
as to be distinct from others in color, and are renewed
when worn out. They also wear necklaces to
which a shell or bead is added every year, and when the
boy has ten added to his string, he is called <i>muhasal</i>, or
ten, signifying half a man; when the twentieth and final
shell is added, he is considered a full man, and is called
<i>all</i>, meaning twenty. If his intended has by this time
attained her fifteenth year, preparations are at once made
for the marriage. A general holiday is taken by the
villagers, who clear from grass a circular piece of ground,
which is defined by a ring of stones, and trampled smooth;
a little hut is then erected in the centre having a small
opening at the top, and another at the side facing the
east. Within the hut, the entrance of which is covered
with a mat, is a heap of copal-twigs, and without, at the
edge of the circle, a canoe filled with palm-wine is
placed, having a large pile of white calabashes by its
side. At noon the villagers proceed to the home of the
bridegroom, who is addressed in turn by the old men;
they then start with the youth for the house of the bride
where the young man seats himself before the closed entrance
on a bundle of presents intended for the bride.
The father raps at the door which is partly opened by
an old woman who asks his business, but the reply does
not seem satisfactory, for the door is slammed in his
face. The old men try their power of persuasion with the
same result, and at last determine to call Orpheus to
their aid. Music hath charms! the door is seen to open,
and a female peeps timidly out: louder swells the music,
and the bridegroom hastens to unroll his bundle containing
beads and other articles. The door opens wider and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">733</a></span>
wider as each present is handed in by the father, until
it is entirely thrown back, revealing the bride arrayed
in her prettiest, seated on a crickery, in the remotest
corner. While all are absorbed in examining the presents,
the bridegroom dashes in, shoulders the girl like
a sack, and trots off for the mystic circle, which, urged
on by the frantic cries of the women, he reaches before
the crowd can rescue her. The females, who cannot
pass the ring, stand outside giving vent to their despairing
shrieks, while the men squat within the circle in
rows, facing outward. The old men alone remain standing,
and one of them hands a lighted stick to the couple
inside the hut, with a short speech. Soon an aromatic
smoke curls up from the copal pile, whereat the women
grow silent, but when it subsides, a sudden gayety takes
possession of them, and the music is again heard. The
reason for this is that the bridegroom, if he has any objections
to the girl, may expel her while the gum is
burning, but if it burns out quietly, the groom is supposed
to be satisfied and the marriage complete. The
women now pass filled calabashes to the men, who soon
become excited and start a dance which increases in
wildness with each additional cup, and does not end till
most of them have bitten the dust. After dark the
crowd proceeds with lighted torches to the hut, which is
torn down, disclosing the married pair sitting demurely
side by side. The husband shoulders his new baggage
and is escorted to his home. The following day everybody
presents a gift of some kind, so as to place the
couple on an equal footing with the rest of the villagers.<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>The position of a wife is not an enviable one, as the care
of the household, the farm, and all hard and degrading
work fall to her share, while her liege lord spends most
of his time in idling. When about to be confined, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">734</a></span>
proceeds to a hut erected for this purpose in the forest, a
short distance from the village, where she remains from a
week to two months, according to the custom of the tribe,
attended by female friends who supply all her wants,
since she is not allowed to handle food herself. No one
must pass to the windward of the hut, because an obstruction
of the air might cause the death of the mother and
child, and for thus offending the guilty party must pay
the damages. In such seclusion it is easy to dispose of
deformed children, and it is believed that this is done to
avoid the disgrace of a nickname, which might otherwise
attach to the family. At the expiration of the period of
purification, the mother returns to the village carrying the
infant tied to her back in a cloth. The village witch
has in the meantime fastened round its neck, a <i>pew</i> or
charm, consisting of a bag of small seeds with which to
pay old Charon for ferriage across the river, in case of
an early death. The child is suckled for about two years;
yucca-root pap also forms a great part of its food in some
parts, but otherwise it receives little care. The mother
delivers herself, cutting the navel-string with her own
hand; she also washes the infant's clothes, for it
is believed that the child will die if this is done
by another; after washing herself and suckling the child
she returns to the village. Formerly all children born
within the year were taken to the temple by the parents,
wrapped in a net and painted cloth, and laid to sleep
under a cake made of honey and iguana-flesh. Notice
was taken of dreams, and if the child appeared well and
happy, they augured riches and long life for it, if weak
and sorrowful, it would be poor and unfortunate; if no
dreams occurred, it betokened an early death. Acting on
this superstition, parents often became careless about the
future of their children, and suffered them to grow up
without attention. Priests were not allowed to marry,
and the care and education of the sons of prominent men
were entrusted to them.<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO DIVERSIONS.</p>

<p>Drinking is the chief amusement, and to become
helplessly drunk is the sum of all enjoyment. Frequent
<i>sihkrans</i> or feasts are held, lasting for days, at
which large numbers assist to drain the canoeful of
liquor prepared for the occasion. Occasionally surrounding
villagers are invited, and a drinking-bout is
held, first in one house and then in another, until the
climax is reached in a debauch by both sexes of the
most revolting character. Quarrels are generally put
off for these occasions, but, as the wives have carefully
hidden all weapons, recourse is had to the fist, with
which the combatants exchange blows in turn until one
has had enough. These trials of endurance are also
held in sport; the Smoo or Woolwa, for instance, who
wishes to be held most worthy of the fair sex, engages
in a <i>lowta</i> or striking-match with a rival, each one
presenting his bent back to the other in turn, until the
bravest stands declared. Death is not unfrequently the
result of such trials. Even boys, carried away by emulation,
hold lighted sticks to each other's skin. In
early times the people of Honduras held regular festivals
at the beginning of each month, at the time of
electing officers, at harvest time, and three other grand
celebrations during the year, for which much food and
drink were prepared. As the wine took effect, the participants
were seized with a desire to move to the exhilarating
sound of drum, flute, and rattle, and a simple
dance was organized. That of the Carib is merely a
forward and backward movement of hands and feet,
accompanied by a peculiar intonation of voice, and at
their <i>seekroes</i>, or festivals in commemoration of the departed,
they stalk in a circle, one following the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">736</a></span>
and singing in a loud and uncouth tone. Their pas seul
is livelier, however, the performer skipping up and
down, bending the body in different ways, and making
the most grotesque movements. They are not satisfied
with a mere drinking-bout at their reunions, but spread
a good table, to which guests often bring their own
liquor. The Towkas and others prefer the circle dance,
walking at a slow, swinging pace, beating their knuckles
against emptied calabashes, and joining in a refrain, at
the end of which they strike their cups one against
another's. At each additional potation, the walk is increased
in speed, until it assumes a trot and ends in a
gallop, the calabashes rattling in accordance. The
Sambo dance is like a minuet, in which the performers
advance and recede, making strange gesticulations. The
women have also a dance among themselves,&mdash;for they
are not allowed to join with the men,&mdash;in which they
form a ring, holding each other round the waist with
the left hand, bending, wriggling, shaking calabash rattles,
and singing until exhausted. Dramatic representations
usually accompany these saltatory exhibitions,
wherein the various phases of a lover's trials, comical
sketches, or battles are depicted. The people of Honduras
are fond of disguising themselves with feather tufts,
and skins of animals, whose actions and cries they imitate.
The favorite entertainment of the Sambos is to
put on a head-dress of thin strips of wood painted in
various colors to represent the beak of a sword-fish,
fasten a collar of wood round the neck, from which a
number of palm-leaves are suspended, and to daub the
face red, black, and yellow. Two men thus adorned
advance toward one another and bend the fish-head in
salute, keeping time with a rattle and singing, "shovel-nosed
sharks, grandmother!" after which they slide off
crab-like, making the most ludicrous gestures imaginable.
This fun exhausted, fresh men appear, introducing
new movements, and then the spectators join in a 'walk
around,' flourishing white sticks in their hands, and
repeating the above-mentioned refrain in a peculiar buzzing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">737</a></span>
tone produced by placing in the mouth a small
tube covered with the membrane of a nut.<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GUAJIQUERO DANCE.</p>

<p>The Guajiqueros in an interesting performance described
by Squier, depict incidents from their history.
A square piece of ground having a tree in the centre is
marked off, and two poles adorned with feathers are
erected in opposite corners, one bearing the head of a
deer, the other that of a tiger. A dull, monotonous
music is heard, and two parties of youth, fantastically
dressed up and painted, move up to the square in a slow,
but not ungraceful dance, and station themselves round
the poles that bear their respective insignia. A man,
stooping as if bent with age, starts out from the deers,
dances round the ground, trying to arouse the mirth of
the spectators with his grotesque movements. The
tigers also dispatch a man, who does his best to excel
the other one in contortions and grimaces. After a
while they meet, and commence a discussion which ends
in open rupture, the rising passions being well delineated.
The two men who represent ambassadors then return to
their party with an account of the mission, the result of
which is a general excitement, both factions starting
out, dancing backwards and forwards, up and down the
square, until they meet under the tree, in the centre.
The leader of each then steps out and recites the glories
and prowess of his tribe, amidst the applause of his own
men, and the disapproval of the others. As soon as
they are worked up to the requisite pitch of irritation,
the dialogue ceases, the music strikes up, and a mimic
combat ensues, in which the armies advance and retreat,
close and separate, using short canes for weapons.
At last the tigers lose their standard and take to flight,
whereat the victors execute a dance of triumph; but
finding how dearly the victory has been bought, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">738</a></span>
joy is turned into sorrow, and they bend their head
upon the knees, breaking out in loud lament. In a few
moments one of them starts up and begins a panegyric on
the fallen brave, which is followed by a mimic sacrifice
and other ceremonies. The vanquished are now seen to
approach with downcast eyes, bringing tribute, which
they lay at the feet of the victors, who receive it with
imperious bearing. The music at these entertainments
is not of a very inspiring nature; drums, consisting of a
section of hollow tree covered with skin, which are generally
beaten with the hand, and flutes of bamboo with
four stops on which eight notes are played with different
degrees of speed for variety, being the usual instruments.
The Guajiqueros also use the <i>chirimaya</i>, two flutes joined
in one mouthpiece; the <i>syrinx</i>, or Pan's pipe; a long
calabash with a narrow opening at the small end, into
which the performer blows suddenly, at intervals, to
mark time; and a sort of drum consisting of a large
earthen jar, over the mouth of which a dressed skin is
tightly stretched. To the centre of the skin, and passing
through an opening in the bottom, is attached a string
which the performer pulls, the rebound of the membrane
producing a very lugubrious sound. In western Honduras
the so-called strum-strum is much used. This is
a large gourd cut in the middle, and covered with a thin
board having strings attached. The <i>marimba</i>, and the
jews-harp which has been introduced by the trader, are,
however, the favorite instruments for a quiet reunion,
and the few tunes known to them are played thereon with
admirable skill and taste. Songs always accompany their
dances and are usually impromptu compositions on suitable
subjects, gotten up for the occasion by the favorite
singers of the village, and rendered in a soft, but monotonous
and plaintive tone. They have no national melodies,
but on the receipt of any good or bad message, their
feelings generally find vent in a ditty embodying the
news. Talking is a passion with them, and as soon as a
piece of news is received at a village, two or three younger
men will start with their women and children for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">739</a></span>
next hamlet, where it is discussed for hours by the assembled
population, who in their turn dispatch a messenger
to the next village, and thus spread the news over
the whole country in a very short time. In story-telling,
those who concoct the biggest lies receive the most
applause. Of course, the pipe must be smoked on these
occasions, but as their own tobacco has become too mild
for them, recourse is had to the vilest description of
American leaf. When this is wanting, the smoke-dried
leaves of the trumpet and papah-tree are used by men as
<span class="sidenote">BEVERAGES OF HONDURAS.</span>
well as women. The favorite drink is <i>mishla</i>, prepared
chiefly from cassava-roots; but others from bananas, pine-apples,
and other fruits are also used. A number of
young women provided with good teeth, untiring jaws,
and a large supply of saliva, are employed to chew
about half of the boiled and peeled roots requisite to make
a canoeful of liquor, the remainder being crushed in a
mortar. This delectable compound is stirred with cold
water, and allowed to ferment for a day or two, when it
assumes a creamy appearance, and tastes very strong and
sour. Plantains are kneaded in warm water, and then
allowed to stand for a few days till the mixture ferments,
or the fruit is left in the water in small pieces, and the
kneading performed in the cup previous to drinking. A
fermented drink from powdered cacao and indigenous
sugar-cane juice is called <i>ulung</i>, and <i>pesso</i> is the name
given to another made from crushed lime-rinds, maize
and honey; in early times mead was a favorite drink in
Honduras. The cocoa-nut palm yields monthly a large
quantity of liquor known as <i>caraca</i>. The tip of the
undeveloped shoots are cut off, and the branch bent down
so as to allow the fluid to drip into a calabash placed
beneath. Its seeds, when crushed and steeped in hot
water give the <i>acchioc</i>.<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>No name for a supreme good spirit is found in the
vocabulary of the Mosquitos; all their appeals are addressed
to Wulasha, the devil, the cause of all misfortunes
and contrarieties that happen. The intercessors
with this dread being are the <i>sukias</i>, or sorceresses, generally
dirty, malicious old hags, who are approached with
gifts by the trembling applicant, and besought to use
their power to avert impending evils. They are supposed
to be in partnership with their devil, for whom
they always exact the half of the fee before entering
upon any exorcising or divination. These witches exercise
a greater power over the people than the chief&mdash;a
power which is sustained by the exhibition of certain
tricks, such as allowing poisonous snakes to bite them,
and handling fire, which they have learned from predecessors
during their long preparation for the office,
passed amidst exposure and fasts in the solitude of the
wilderness. The people of Honduras had also evil sorcerers
who possessed the power of transforming men into
wild beasts, and were much feared and hated accordingly;
but their priests or hermits who live in communion
with materialized gods, in small, elevated huts,
apart from the villages, enjoyed the respect of all, and
their advice was applied for on every matter of importance.
None but the principal men could approach them
without the necessary offering of maize and fowl, and
they humbly knelt before them to receive their oracular
answer. Preparatory to important undertakings, dogs,
cocks, and even men were sacrificed to obtain the favor
of their idols, and blood was drawn from tongue, ears,
and other members of the body. They thought it likewise
necessary to their welfare to have <i>naguals</i>, or guardian
spirits, whose life became so bound up with their
own that the death of one involved that of the other.
The manner of obtaining this guardian was to proceed
to some secluded spot and offer up a sacrifice: with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">741</a></span>
beast or bird which thereupon appeared, in dream or in
reality, a compact for life was made, by drawing blood
from various parts of the body. Caribs and Woolwas
assemble at certain periods every year, to propitiate controlling
spirits with ceremonies transmitted from their
forefathers. A variety of ghosts, as Lewire, the spirit
of the water, are supposed to play their pranks at night,
and it is difficult to induce anyone to leave the hut
after dark, unless in company. The belief in dreams
is so firmly rooted that their very course of life is influenced
by it. Every dream has a direct or indirect
meaning; thus, a broken calabash betokens loss of wife;
a broken dish, the death of a mother. Among other
superstitions, it was believed that the lighting of an owl
upon the house-top would be followed by the death of
an inmate; when thunder roared, cotton-seed was burned;
broken egg-shells and deer-bones were carefully preserved
lest the chickens or the deer should die or disappear.
Aware of the peculiar influence of the moon on
man and matter, they are careful not to sleep in its
glare, nor to fish when it is up, and mahogany-cutters
abstain from felling trees at certain periods for fear the
wood may spoil. They are wonderfully good pathfinders,
and will pass through the densest forest without
guiding marks; as swimmers they are not to be surpassed.
Their mode of greeting a friend is very effusive,
according to Dampier. One will throw himself at
the feet of another, who helps him up, embraces him,
and falls down in his turn to be assisted up and comforted
with a pressure. Cockburn says that the Honduras
people bend one knee to the ground and clap their
hands in token of farewell.<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>

<p>Their licentious life, and fruit and fish diet, with limited
use of salt, have left their constitution very susceptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">742</a></span>
to epidemics as well as other diseases. The most
common disorders are affections of the bowels, such as
dysentery and diarrh&oelig;a, but chills, rheumatism, consumption,
and measles are not unfrequent. Children
suffer much from worms, and their abdomen is sometimes
enormously swollen. A very painful, though
not dangerous eye-disease termed <i>unkribikun</i> is prevalent;
and the burrowing of the tick in the skin causes
wounds and inflammation if the fly be not speedily removed;
the <i>chegoe</i>, or sand-flea, attacks the feet in the
same manner. But small-pox and leprosy are the greatest
scourges of this country, the former having here as
elsewhere in America committed enormous ravages
among the population. Leprosy&mdash;that living death
reflecting the sins of former generations, so capricious
in the selection of its victims, taking the parent, yet
leaving the child intact, or seizing upon the offspring
without touching its mother&mdash;may certainly be less destructive,
but it is nevertheless fearful in its effect; half
of the natives of the Mosquito country being more or
less marked by it, either in the shape of white or livid
spots, or red, white, and scabbed <i>bulpis</i>. All sickness
and affliction is supposed to be the work of the evil
spirit who has taken possession of the affected part; sukias
must, therefore, be called in to use their incantations
and herbs against the enemy. The witch appears
with her face painted in hideous devices, and begins
operations by placing some herbs beneath the pillow of
the patient, blowing smoke over him, rubbing the
body with the hands, and muttering strange words. If
this is not effective, a decoction is made from the herbs,
to be used as a drink or fomentation, and the patient is
fenced in with painted sticks, with strict orders to let
no one approach; the witch herself bringing the food to
the patient, whistling a plaintive strain and muttering
over the invalid for some time to chase away the evil.
No pregnant woman, or person who has lately buried a
friend, must come near the house during the illness, nor
must any one pass to the windward of it, lest the sick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">743</a></span>
be deprived of breath; any presumed breach of these
injunctions leaving a safe loophole for the sorceress, in
case her remedies fail. During epidemics, the sukias
consult together and note their dreams, to ascertain the
nature and disposition of the spirit. After muttering
incantations all night, and invoking all sorts of terrible
monsters, they plant small painted sticks, mounted by
grotesque figures, to the windward of the village, and
announce the expulsion of the evil. Should the scourge
continue, it is supposed that the spirits are obstinate, and
the people remove to other parts, burning the village.
The instructions of the sukia are always scrupulously
followed, and the credulous native may be seen lying on
the beach for days, exposed to all weathers, smeared
with blood and waiting for restoration from ills. Scarifications
are much resorted to, and fever patients throw
themselves into cold water, where they remain until
dead or until the fever leaves them. In Honduras, on
the other hand, the patient is taken out of the water
after a short immersion, and rolled to and fro before a
fire, until half dead with fatigue, when he was left to
be restored by sleep; blood is let from the thighs, legs,
and shoulders; vomiting is promoted by certain herbs;
vermin are administered for jaundice. In sickness a
rigid diet is observed, the patient subsisting chiefly on
iguana broth. Snake-bites are cured by chewing the
guaco-root, and poulticing the wound therewith; the
Caribs apply an oil obtained from the head of the tommy-goff
as an antidote for its bite. Herrera states
that the comfort of a sick person was but little regarded;
bread and drink were placed near the patient's head,
and if strong enough to partake thereof, well and good,
but if not he might die; nobody took any notice of
him after this. The Mosquitos are not entirely devoid
of affection; but their grief seems to be reserved for the
dead, not the dying.<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">744</a></span></p>

<p>The corpse is wrapped in a cloth and placed in one
half of a pitpan which has been cut in two; friends
assemble for the funeral and drown their grief in mushla,
the women giving vent to their sorrow by dashing
themselves on the ground until covered with blood, and
inflicting other tortures, occasionally even committing
suicide. As it is supposed that the evil spirit seeks to
obtain possession of the body, musicians are called in to
lull it to sleep, while preparations are made for its removal;
all at once four naked men, who have disguised
themselves with paint, so as not to be recognized
and punished by Wulasha, rush out from a neighboring
hut, and, seizing the rope attached to the canoe, drag
it into the woods, followed by the music and the crowd.
Here the pitpan is lowered into the grave with bow,
arrow, spear, paddle, and other implements to serve the
departed in the land beyond; then the other half of the
boat is placed over the body. A rude hut is constructed
over the grave, serving as a receptacle for the choice food,
drink, and other articles placed there from time to time
by relatives. The water that disappears from the porous
jars is thought to have been drunk by the deceased, and
if the food is nibbled by birds it is held to be a good
sign. On returning from the grave the property of the
deceased is destroyed, the cocoa-palms being cut down,
and all who have taken part in the funeral undergo
a lustration in the river. Relatives cut off the hair, the
men leaving a ridge along the middle from the nape
of the neck to the forehead; widows, according to some
old writers, after supplying the grave with food for
a year, take up the bones, and carry them on the
back in the daytime, sleeping with them at night, for
another year, after which they are placed at the door,
or upon the house-top. On the anniversary of death,
friends of the deceased hold a feast called <i>seekroe</i>, at
which large quantities of liquor are drained to his
memory. Squier, who witnessed the ceremonies on an
occasion of this kind, says that males and females were
dressed in <i>ule</i> cloaks fantastically painted black and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">745</a></span>
white, while their faces were correspondingly streaked
with red and yellow, and they performed a slow walk-around,
the immediate relatives prostrating themselves
at intervals, calling loudly upon the dead, and tearing
the ground with their hands. At no other time is the
departed referred to, the very mention of his name being
superstitiously avoided. Some tribes extend a thread
from the house of death to the grave, carrying it in a
straight line over every obstacle. Froebel states that
among the Woolwas all property of the deceased is
buried with him, and that both husband and wife cut
the hair and burn the hut on the death of either, placing
a gruel of maize upon the grave for a certain time.<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE MOSQUITOS.</p>

<p>Hospitality, a gentle and obliging disposition, faithfulness
in the fulfilling of engagements, honesty and
docility, balanced by an inaptness to make any avail of
natural benefits, and a supineness in matters of veracity
and judgment, by reason of which they fall into many
excesses, especially in drink, characterize both Mosquitos
and Caribs. The apathy and slowness of the unadulterated
aboriginal are, however, in striking contrast to the
vivacious and impressible nature of the Caribs, whose versatility
evidences a rather higher intelligence, which is
again overshadowed by an inordinate vanity, based chiefly
upon their greater strength and stature. Both possess a
certain industry, the one being more plodding, the other
more energetic though less patient; this trait is also
noticeable in their pastimes, where the native is far less
exuberant and noisy than his darker neighbor. With
regard to the effect of negro admixture on character,
comparisons may be made among the Caribs themselves,
when it will be found that the black race is much more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">746</a></span>
mercurial and vehement than the purer type, and possesses
greater volubility. The severe discipline kept up,
and the disposition, among the women at least, to provide
for the morrow, augurs well for their future. The
bravery and love of freedom which so long kept the
Spanish invaders at bay both on the western and northern
borders and on the coast was subsequently subdued,
instance the mild disposition of the independent Xicaques,
Poyas, and Secos, who are now inclined rather
to peaceful diplomacy than to warlike demonstrations;
yet the Caribs manifested considerable spirit during a
late conflict with the Honduras government, and proved
themselves efficient soldiers. The character given to the
nations of this subdivision by ancient writers, contains
many unenviable qualities, for not only are they described
as lazy, vicious, lying, inconstant, but as cruel,
void of affection, and of less intelligence than the Mexicans;
nevertheless they are obedient, peaceable, and
quiet. The only characteristic we have concerning the
Albatuins is that they were savage, and until of late
the Ramas bore the same character. Among the industrious
Towkas we find that gentle melancholy
which characterizes some of the Guatemalans; while
their brothers, the Smoos, have the reputation of being
a very simple people whom the neighbors take delight
in imposing upon, yet their women are said to be more
ingenious than the Sambo women. Proceeding to the
Toonglas and Sambos, we observe a preponderance of
bad qualities, attributable, no doubt, to their intercourse
with buccaneers and traders. By most writers they are
characterized as a lazy, drunken, debauched, audacious
race, given to thieving; capricious, quarrelsome, treacherous
and exacting among themselves, though obliging to
strangers, their only redeeming traits being hospitality,
and a certain impulsiveness which is chiefly exhibited
in grief, and indicates something good at heart. Their
want of energy, which deters them alike from household
work and the commission of great crimes, will not prevent
them from undertaking wearisome voyages to dispose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">747</a></span>
of mere trifles; and their superstitious fears and
puerility under affliction, are entirely lost when facing
the raging surf or hungry shark. Other writers take advantage
of this trait to show that they are high-spirited
enough to carry anything through when once aroused,
and add that they have proved themselves faithful to
their masters, are docile and intelligent, abhorring to
appear mean and cowardly.<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE ISTHMIANS.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Isthmians</span>, by which name I designate all the
nations occupying the territory lying between the San
Juan River and the southern shore of Lake Nicaragua
on the north, and the gulf of Urabá, or Darien, and the
River Atrato on the south, present several peculiarities
when compared with the other nations of Central America.
The inhabitants of these regions are a hardy and
active race, jealous of their independence and ever hostile
to those who attempt to penetrate their country.
Their resoluteness in excluding all foreigners is materially
strengthened by the rugged and malarious nature
of the country, by its deep ravines, its miasmatic swamps,
its abrupt heights, its rapid streams, its tangled undergrowth,
and densely wooded districts. The air of the
table-lands and valleys is hot and moist, the soil exceedingly
fertile, but the interior and mountainous localities
have a milder and more temperate climate with but
little variation except that of the dry and wet seasons.
In the lowlands of Panamá, the swampy nature of the
surface, with the great humidity of the atmosphere, produces
a luxuriant vegetation, and the consequent quantity
of decomposed vegetable matter under the influence
of a vertical sun, engenders a miasma deadly to the unacclimated.
The rich and marshy nature of the soil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">748</a></span>
however, sends forth immense palm-trees, in the branches
of which the natives build their houses, thus obtaining
a purer air and greater safety from the numerous wild
animals and dangerous reptiles that infest that region.
A great portion of the territory is rich in minerals which
were once produced by the natives in great quantities,
but which, unfortunately, were the loadstone that drew
upon them the ruthless Spanish plunderers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN NATIONS.</p>

<p>In the northern part of Costa Rica along the head
waters of the Rio Frio the <i>Guatusos</i>, or <i>Pranzas</i>, are located.
Mr Squier is inclined to think they are of the
same stock as the Nahuas. Some striking physical
peculiarities observed among them have given rise to
various surmises and startling conclusions regarding
their origin. Dwelling in the western part of the state
are the <i>Terrabas</i> and the <i>Changuenes</i>, fierce and barbarous
nations, at constant enmity with their neighbors.
In the south-east and extending to the borders
of Chiriquí dwell the <i>Talamancas</i> composed of a number
of different tribes and declared by some to be allied in
race with the Guatusos. Besides these are the <i>Buricas</i>,
<i>Torresques</i>, <i>Toxas</i>, and others.<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> In the mountains of
Chiriquí are the <i>Valientes</i>, so called by the Spaniards from
their heroic resistance to the invaders. Many of the
warlike nations who occupied the country at the time of
the discovery derived their names from the caciques
that governed them. The people who dwell along the
shore of the Caribbean Sea, between Portobello and
Urabá, and occupy the Limones, Sasardi, and Pinos
islands are supposed to be a branch of the once powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">749</a></span>
Darien nations who to the present day remain unconquered.
Their province is situated on the western shore
of the gulf of Urabá, and their town was originally near
the mouth of the River Atrato. The town and the river
as well as the province were called by the natives Darien.
This town was conquered in 1510 by a little band
of shipwrecked Spaniards under the Bachiller Enciso.
Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, Francisco Pizarro, and men of
like metal were there, and this was the first successful
conquest and settlement on Tierra Firme. Whence, as
the conquests of the Spaniards widened, the name Darien
was at length applied to the greater part of the Isthmus.
Still further westward were the once powerful province
of <i>Cueva</i>, and the site of the ancient city of Panamá, discovered
in 1515 by Tello de Guzman. This was a
famous fishing-station, the word Panamá signifying in
the native tongue a place where many fish are taken.
Along the western shore of the bay of Panamá dwelt
several independent and warlike nations, those of <i>Cutara</i>,
<i>Paris</i>, <i>Escoria</i>, besides many others who waged continual
war against each other with the object of increasing
their territories and adding lustre to their
names.<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>Slight differences only are observable in the Isthmian
physique. The people are generally well-built, muscular,
and of average height, although old authorities, such as
Herrera, Andagoya, and Gomara, describe a tribe, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">750</a></span>
they locate near Escoria and Quarecas, as being very
tall&mdash;veritable giants. Women, as a rule, are small and
of delicate proportions, but after attaining a certain age,
incline to obesity. The mountain tribes are generally
shorter in stature, with more pleasing features than the
coast-dwellers. A notable difference between the Isthmians
and the other aborigines of the Pacific States, is
the short, rather flat nose, in contradistinction to the
almost universal aquiline cast. In color they are of a
medium bronze tint, varying according to localities, the
mountain tribes being the darker. Black, straight, and
very abundant coarse hair, black or dark eyes, and
excellent teeth predominate.<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> In Costa Rica, on the
Rio Frio, is the frequently spoken of but never accurately
described nation&mdash;the <i>Guatusos</i>&mdash;whom somewhat mythical
accounts describe as of fair complexions, with light
hair and blue eyes. Likewise Albinos are spoken of by
Wafer, who relates having seen people "milk white,
lighter than the colour of any Europeans, and much
like that of a white horse." Furthermore, it is said
that their bodies were covered with a milk-white down,
which added to the whiteness of their skin; hair and
eyebrows white, and eyes oblong, with the corners pointing
downwards. During daylight they were weak-sighted,
restive, and lacking energy, but after sundown,
their cheerfulness, activity, and eyesight returned&mdash;the
latter being apparently as good as that of other people.<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>

in a wet state until soft and pliant, were the materials
used by the Isthmians to cover their nakedness, if, indeed,
they covered it at all. Where cotton was used, as
in parts of Costa Rica, the costume was simply a small
strip of cloth which both men and women wound round
the loins or, as on the islands in the gulf of Nicoya, the
women passed it between the legs, and fastened it to a
string round the waist. These latter ornamented their
scanty raiment prettily with various designs painted in
colors, and also with seeds and shells. Near the bay of
Herradura the men wore a kind of mantle covering the
whole front and back of the wearer, made of the above-mentioned
bark, in the centre of which was a hole
through which the head passed. The women of this
locality only wrap themselves in a piece of bark, without
taking the trouble to fashion a mantle of it. Yet
more simple was the dress of the men near Cartago; a
few cotton strings wound round the foreskin of their
virile member, sufficed them.<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Near Panamá and Darien,
the caciques only wore long cotton mantles thrown
over the shoulder and reaching nearly to the feet, the
common people going naked, only encasing their privy
parts in a kind of funnel made of gold, silver, shell, or
bamboo, according to the wealth of the wearer, and
which was held in place by a string fastened to two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">752</a></span>
holes in the sides which was passed round the waist.
Women in the same localities wore cotton petticoats
reaching to the knees, or, if ladies of quality, to the
ankles. Near the gulf of Nicoya, women wore the long
hair parted in the middle from the front to the back of
the head, and plaited into two braids which hung down
on either side over the ears. The men tied the hair up
in a stiff queue with a cotton band, which was at times
arranged so as to rise straight over the crown of the
head. Necklaces of colored beads or of tiger's teeth
were worn as ornaments. Like many nations of the
Hyperborean group, the Chorotegans of Nicoya pierced
the lower lip and inserted a round piece of bone. Their
arms they painted with a mixture of their own blood
and charcoal. In portions of Veragua and Behetrias
even the funnel or cotton strings were omitted, and the
Gugures, Mandingos, and many others on the Pacific
seaboard, like the people of Veragua, went entirely naked,
the chiefs only wearing long mantles. All of the
Isthmians were fond of ornaments; among those which
deserve special notice is the nose-pendant. This was a
crescent-shaped piece of gold or silver, of various sizes
for different occasions, those used on holidays hanging
down so as to cover the mouth, while those for ordinary
use only reached the upper lip. Besides the nose-pendant
were ear-rings and a number of heavy necklaces of
gold, silver, tiger's teeth, colored seeds, shells, and coral,
according to the wealth of the wearer. Under their
breasts the richer women also wore gold bars as a support,
which were held up by strings passed over the
shoulders. <i>Guanines</i>, or figures of animals made of gold,
were worn around the neck by the men on the coast of
Veragua, Chiriquí, and Urabá; others again wore on
their heads fillets or crowns of gold or of the claws of
wild beasts, or of feathers. Thus did these naked savages
decorate themselves, often to the extent of several
pounds weight. Women considered it a mark of beauty
to have thick legs, and to that end wore bandages
round them. Another Hyperborean custom is here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">753</a></span>
met with&mdash;the anointing of the body with oil&mdash;which
in these tropics is extracted from the <i>bixa</i> or seed of the
<i>arnotto</i>, and over which they sprinkled down and feathers.
Painting the body was everywhere practiced, and
was carried to a great extent, the different colors and
figures employed each having its peculiar significance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN BODY-PAINTING.</p>

<p>On going to war, paint was used more freely than at
other times, and the greater the warrior the thicker the
paint. Among the men of Cueba painting had a double
object; it served as an ornament to the person, and also
as a mark of distinction of rank. The chief, when he
inherited or attained his title, made choice of a certain
device, which became that of all his house. Freemen
were painted from the mouth downward, and on the
arms and chest, while slaves were only painted or tattooed
from the mouth upward. All the lords, servitors,
and vassals who were freemen, were painted in exactly
the same manner. If the son of a chief adopted the
ancestral totem, he could not afterward change it on
coming into his inheritance, but if during his father's
life-time he declined to use the distinctive badge of his
house, he could, when he became chief, choose any new
device he might fancy. A son who did not adopt his
father's totem was always hateful to him during his
lifetime. The natives on the northern coast of Chiriquí
painted the body in wavy lines, from the shoulders to
the heels; through the cartilage of the nose they stuck a
porcupine-quill, and in the chin the tooth of a wild
beast. The women had holes made in their cheeks
through which they stuck little bunches of feathers;
they also wore tiger's claws in their ears. At San Blas,
some of the men painted themselves in black streaks,
and the women in red. At Porto Belo, the king was
painted black and all his subjects red. The natives of
Escoria tattooed breast and arms; the women of Darien
across the bridge of the nose from one cheek to the
other; they also blacken their teeth. Others have
figures of birds, animals, or trees painted all over the
body, according to fancy; their favorite colors being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">754</a></span>
black, red, and yellow, which are laid on with pencils
made of wood, chewed at the end till they become soft.<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>
All the Isthmians pull out the hair from every part of
the body except the head, and rub themselves with
herbs, which prevent its further growth. Both sexes
pride themselves on the length of the hair, and most of
them allow it to grow to its full length and hang loose
over their shoulders, but keep it cut on the forehead as
low as the eyebrows. The men of Cariai and some
parts of Chiriquí, bind it with fillets and wind it in rolls
round the head, fastening it with a comb made of the
heart of the palm-tree; others wear round their head a
band made of bark or certain fibres of plants, and at
festivals they often wear high caps, made from the gaudy
feathers of parrots. At Tanela married women cut their
hair short. It appears that head-flattening again crops
out in these parts. Las Casas states that infants had
their heads placed between two pads, one in front and
another behind, in order to increase the length of the
head and width of the forehead.<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DWELLINGS ON THE ISTHMUS.</p>

<p>In Costa Rica many of the natives live in small huts
built of plaited rushes. In the year 1545, Diego Gutierrez,
governor of Nueva Cartago, in Costa Rica, attempted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">755</a></span>
to explore that territory. Arriving at the
province of Suere upon a river of that name at a point
some twelve leagues distant from the North Sea, he
came to a village, and there occupied a house belonging
to the chief of the district. The old Milanese chronicler,
Girolamo Benzoni, who accompanied the expedition,
describing the dwelling of the cacique, says it was
shaped like an egg and was forty-five paces in length
and nine in breath. The sides were of reeds and the
roof of palm-leaves all interlaced and well executed.
There were but few other houses in the village and
those of inferior character. Padre Zepeda, a jesuit, who
in 1750 lived among the Guatusos for several months,
speaking of their towns and gardens, says that when
the rains commence, they construct small huts in the
trees, where they live safe from the danger of floods.<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>
Unlike most other nations, the Isthmians do not build
their villages in squares, but generally form long streets,
keeping the houses well apart from each other, probably
as a precaution against conflagrations. On many parts of
the coast of Darien and on the gulf of Urabá, the villages
are built in the water. Others are on the banks of rivers,
and many of them are spacious and constructed with
great skill and attention to details. The supporting
posts of the roof are large bamboos or palm-trees. Three
or four of these are driven into the ground at equal distances,
proportioned according to the intended length of
the house, and across the top is laid the ridge-pole; on
each side a number of shorter posts are sunk, from
which long rafters are laid to the ridge-pole; the whole
is then covered with palm-leaves, both roof and sides.
Other houses are plastered inside and outside with mud,
and these have a flooring of open bamboo work, raised
six or eight feet from the ground. The dwellings are
divided into two or more rooms, having no doors to the
entrances, which are reached by ladders. Sometimes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">756</a></span>
house is built without walls, in which case the roof
descends to below the level of the floor, and the structure
is left open at both ends, having the appearance of
an elevated platform. The Savanerics and some others
on the coast of Veragua build circular or pyramidal
dwellings, by driving strong posts into the ground
sloping toward each other, so as to unite in a point
where they are strongly bound with withes or vines,
across which are tied small sticks, some peeled, others
with the bark on, or blackened, thereby producing a
pleasing effect. The walls inside are lined with reeds
beautifully interwoven. The upper portion of the structure
is thatched on the outside with straw and on the
apex is placed an ornament of baked clay. In the centre
of the dwelling is a spacious apartment, and round the
walls are small rooms in which different families reside.<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>
Each village has a public, town, or council house, or
fort, one hundred or more feet in length, constructed in
the same manner as the dwellings, but with no interior
partitions; in the walls are loop-holes for the discharge
of arrows. There is an entrance at each end, and thick
doors, made of split palm-tree and bamboo strongly
bound together with withes, are kept in readiness to shut
out the enemy. The doors are kept in position by strong
posts set in the ground behind them. In the province
of Veragua they build strong wooden fences or palisades
round some of the villages, to protect them from attacks
of enemies and wild beasts. During the expedition of
Gaspar de Espinosa in 1517, Diego de Albitez, who invaded
the province of a cacique named Tabraba, some
distance south-west from Panamá, found the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">757</a></span>
protected by strong fortifications. Their forts are built
with much skill. The ground is first enclosed by a deep
trench, upon the inner bank of which trees are planted,
and the interstices filled up with logs and rocks. In
many parts of the country the inhabitants were found
living in the tops of trees like birds, laying sticks across
from one branch to another, and building their houses
upon them. In 1512, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa surveyed
several channels at the mouth of the River Atrato in
quest of gold and plunder. The surrounding country
was low and marshy, but the soil sent forth immense
palm-trees, in the branches of which the natives built
their houses. Vasco Nuñez, entering an affluent of the
Rio Negro, discovered a large tree-top village, the name
of whose ruler was Abieiba. The houses were divided
into several apartments, each of a size sufficient to accommodate
several families. They were built of wood and
willows, and were so pliable and yet so strong, that the
swaying to and fro of the branches, to which the elastic
tenement yielded, did not in the least interfere with the
safety of the occupants. Ladders, made of a single
large bamboo split in two, were used in making the
ascent and descent. These were drawn up at night, or
in case of the invasion of an enemy. On the coast of
Veragua Columbus discovered similar dwellings, and he
says that he could not account for the custom, unless it
was through fear of griffins which abound in that country,
or of enemies, each tribe being at war with every
other tribe along the coast. The true cause, however,
of their taking to trees for places of residence, is to
place themselves beyond the reach of sudden and violent
floods, which are caused by the swelling of streams
after storms in the mountains, and also in order to be
out of the reach of reptiles and wild beasts in which
that country abounds.<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Some of the Isthmians built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">758</a></span>
large enclosures for the chiefs, which early contemporary
writers call the king's palace. Vasco Nuñez de
Balboa, on his march through the province of Comagre,
situated on the northern coast of Darien about thirty
leagues from the gulf of Urabá, relates that he visited
the dwelling or palace of the cacique Comagre, which
he describes as follows: It was one hundred and fifty
by eighty paces in dimension, constructed upon heavy
posts, which stood within a stone wall. The upper
part of the building was beautifully finished with timbers,
interlaced in such a manner as to strike the beholder
with amazement. The building contained various
apartments&mdash;chambers, pantry, and wine-cellar. In one
very large apartment were sacredly kept the remains of
the king's ancestors arranged round the walls.<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE ISTHMIANS.</p>

<p>The Costa Ricans live chiefly by hunting and fishing,
and many of them cultivate maize, beans, and bananas;
the Talamancas, especially, are agriculturists. According
to Father Zepeda, and others who penetrated some
distance into the country of the Guatusos, they had
large fields under cultivation. Salt is seldom used by
any of these tribes, and none of them ever eat dogs, as
they keep them for hunting purposes. Their chief game
is wild hogs and deer, but they are not very particular
as to their animal diet, for they eat whatever they can
catch, including reptiles. Their mode of cooking fish
renders them exceedingly palatable, which is by roasting
them wrapped in plantain-leaves. Bananas are
usually pulled when green, and buried in sand to ripen.<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>
Many of the other Isthmians are agriculturists, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">759</a></span>
grow considerable quantities of maize, plantains, cacao,
pimiento, and cocoa-nuts; their means of subsistence are
further largely supplemented by game and fish. A
staple article of food among the coast tribes is turtle, of
which they capture large numbers. Monkeys afford
them a favorite meal, and they are especially fond of
iguanas, young alligators, and their eggs. From the
yucca as well as corn they make a good quality of bread.
The Doraches and Guaimies of Veragua subsist mainly
on wild roots and a fruit called <i>pixbaex</i>, somewhat resembling
dates, which toasted, makes an agreeable and
wholesome food. Most of their dishes are highly seasoned
with pimiento, a kind of pepper produced by a
small shrub which is very abundant on Tierra Firme.
The toocan bird lives chiefly on the berry, which it discharges
from the stomach almost immediately after swallowing
it; the natives prefer it thus, as its bitterness is
partly absorbed by the bird. It is said that the Caribs
ate human flesh whenever they had an opportunity.
Herrera says that some of the Isthmians purchased
slaves, whom they sold to the Caribs for food, and the
inhabitants of Paria supplied boys to the natives of Tubrabá
for the same purpose. They cooked the flesh of
their enemies, and ate it seasoned with salt and <i>ají</i>
(chile).<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> When a piece of ground is to be planted, a
number of the villagers collect and cut down the brushwood
on a selected spot; the seed is then scattered among
the wood as it lies. In due time the grain, which is
well sheltered from the sun by the branches, springs up
and overtops them, and when fit for harvesting the ears
are gathered. After this, the underwood and corn-stalks
are set on fire, and the ground continues to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">760</a></span>
used for agricultural purposes. In hunting deer and
wild swine, dogs are used to drive them out of the dense
forest; at other times they set fire to a part of the woods,
and as the animals try to escape, they kill them with
spears and arrows. Birds are killed with a blow-pipe.
When fishing they use nets made of mahoe-bark or silk-grass,
and in places where rocks prevent their using a
net, they catch them with their hands or shoot them
with arrows. Fishing by torchlight with spears is frequently
practiced. The Savanerics poison pools with
pounded leaves of the barbasco, and thus obtain fish
without much labor. For duck-hunting they also employ
the often-described trick of placing a calabash on
the head, and in this manner approach the game. The
men of Cueba are celebrated for making pure white salt
from sea water&mdash;an article much used in this locality.
In the same province a kind of communism obtained; all
provisions were delivered to the chief, who distributed
to each his share. Part of the community were employed
as agriculturists, and part as hunters and fishermen.
At his meals the cacique was served by women,
some of his principal men eating with him.<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>In their personal habits the Isthmians are cleanly;
they bathe generally twice a day and sometimes oftener;
but commonly at sunrise and sunset. The interior of
their dwellings has a neat appearance, and order and
cleanliness prevail in all their domestic arrangements.<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS OF THE ISTHMIANS.</p>

<p>Bows and arrows, long spears, javelins, flint-edged
clubs, and blow-pipes, are the weapons used in these
parts. The bows are beautifully made, those of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">761</a></span>
Costa Ricans being about seven feet long, of a dark-colored,
very hard wood, with the string of well-twisted
silk-grass. Arrows are of the same wood, very long, and
pointed with a porcupine-quill or fish-bone. The bows
and arrows of those farther south are much shorter, and
of black palm-wood, as are also their lances and javelins.
The arrows are pointed with flint or fish-bone, or are
hardened in the fire and barbed; the shaft is of reed
having a piece of hard wood eight or ten inches in length
inserted in the end. The inhabitants of Coiba and some
of the tribes on the western shore of the gulf of Urabá,
do not use bows and arrows. In this respect, so far as I
have observed, they form an exception; as among the
almost innumerable tribes situated between the gulf of
Urabá and the Arctic Ocean I know of none others
where bows and arrows are not used. These people in
battle employ a long wooden sword, and wooden spears,
the ends of which are hardened in the fire and tipped
with bone; they also make use of slings and darts.
Their javelins are thrown with much force and dexterity
by means of a stick slightly grooved to hold the projectile.
It is called <i>estorica</i> and is held between the
thumb and two fingers, there being a small loop on the
side, near the centre, in which the forefinger is placed;
the dart is cast straight from the shoulder, while the
projector is retained in the hand. I have noticed a
somewhat similar contrivance employed by the Aleutian
Islanders.<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> The blow-pipe which is used with much
effect, is about six or seven feet long, and the darts shot
from it are made of Mucaw-wood, very thin with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">762</a></span>
exceedingly sharp point, notched, so that when an
object is struck it breaks off and it is almost impossible
to extract the broken point; others are poisoned so that
a slight wound causes death in a short time. One end
is wrapped with a little cotton, until it fits the tube
which is placed to the mouth and the dart blown out.
It is quite effective for a distance of one hundred yards.
Different varieties of poison have been described by
writers and travelers. Herrera speaks of one which he
says was made with certain grey roots found along the
coast, which were burnt in earthen pipkins and mixed
with a species of poisonous black ant; to this composition
were added large spiders, some hairy caterpillars, the
wings of a bat, and the head and tail of sea-fish called
<i>tavorino</i>, very venomous, besides toads, the tails of snakes,
and manzanillas. All these ingredients were set over a
fire in an open field and well boiled in pots by a slave till
they were reduced to a proper consistency. The unfortunate
slave who attends to the boiling almost invariably
dies from the fumes. Another poisonous composition is
spoken of as having been made of fourteen different ingredients
and another of twenty-four, one that kills in
three days, another in five, and another later, and when
one was employed it was stated that sometimes the
wounded lived as many days as the poison had been made.
The natives said that fire, sea water, and continency were
the antidotes against the venom, others affirmed that
the dung of the wounded person taken in pills or otherwise
was a cure. Peter Martyr writes that the poison
was made by old women skilled in the art, who were
shut up for two days in a house where they boiled the
ingredients; if at the expiration of the time, the women
were found in good health instead of being half dead,
they were punished and the ointment was thrown away.
Captain Cochrane in his <i>Journal in Colombia</i>, says that
they obtain the poison from a small frog called the <i>rana
de veneno</i>. These frogs are kept in a hollow cane and
regularly fed. When required for use, they take one
and pass a pointed stick down its throat and out at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">763</a></span>
of its legs. The pain brings to the back of the toad a
white froth, which is a deadly poison and in it the darts
are rubbed; below the froth a yellow oily matter is
found which is carefully scraped off, as it is also a
powerful poison, but not so lasting as the first substance,
which will retain its deadly properties for a year while
the yellow matter looses its strength after five or six
months.<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> The javelins used by the Caribs were not
made pointed but square at the end, they also have very
long pikes and heavy clubs. When Bartolomé Hurtado
in 1516 visited the island of Caubaco he relates that the
cacique presented him with a golden armor valued at
one thousand castellanos. At the island of Cabo seven
leagues distant, the warriors wore a thick matted armor
of cotton impervious to arrows; they were armed with
pikes and in their march were accompanied with drums,
conchs, and fifes.<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WEAPONS, ARMOR, AND WARS.</p>

<p>Wars arise chiefly from the jealousies and ambition
of rival chieftains. Battles are frequent and sanguinary,
often lasting for many days, and are fought with tenacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">764</a></span>
courage. Throughout Darien it is customary to
place sentinels at night in the highest houses of the
towns, to keep watch and give warning of the approach
of an enemy. At the commencement of a campaign,
chiefs and captains experienced in war are nominated
by the head of the tribe, to lead the men in battle and
conduct the operations; they wear certain insignia, so
as to be distinguished from the rest of the men, lofty
plumes on the head, and a quantity of golden ornaments
and jewels, besides which they are painted in a
different style. All, however, adorn themselves when
going to battle, with a profusion of necklaces, bracelets,
and golden corselets. The men are cheered on to battle
and encouraged during the fight by the blowing of large
shells and the beating of drums. In the province of
Cueba, women accompany the men, fighting by their
side and sometimes even leading the van. The action
is commenced with the slings and estoricas, but they
soon meet at close quarters, when the heavy wooden
swords and javelins are brought into use. Certain rules
and military regulations are observed whereby the brave
are rewarded, and offenders against military discipline
punished. Nobility is conferred on him who is wounded
in war, and he is further rewarded with lands, with
some distinguished woman, and with military command;
he is deemed more illustrious than others, and the son
of such a father, following the profession of arms, may
inherit all the father's honors. He who disobeys the
orders of his chief in battle is deprived of his arms,
struck with them, and driven from the settlement. All
booty is the property of him who captured it. The
prisoner is the slave of the captor; he is branded on the
face and one of his front teeth knocked out. The Caribs,
however, used to kill and eat their prisoners. Wafer
mentions that upon some occasions, he who had killed
an enemy cut off his own hair as a distinguishing mark
of triumph, and painted himself black, continuing so
painted until the first new moon.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">765</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN DISHES AND IMPLEMENTS.</p>

<p>The Isthmians sleep in hammocks, often beautifully
made, and suspended between two trees or upright posts.
Owing to the material of which they are composed they
are exceedingly cool and well adapted to the climate.
Gourds, calabashes, and cocoa-nut shells are employed
for water-bowls and drinking-cups. Their other household
utensils consist of earthen jars, flint knives, stone
hatchets and boxes ingeniously made of palm-leaves,
and covered with deer or other skins. Drums of different
sizes, some very large, others small, are made of the
hollow trunk of a tree covered at the ends with deer's hide.
Those of the largest size are kept at the chief's residence
or at the town-house. Hammocks are made of finely
woven cloth, or more frequently of plaited grass of
various colors and curiously ornamented. Wooden mortars,
made from the knotty part of a tree, are used to
pound yucca, from which they make their cassava. The
metate or rubbing-stone is also in use among them.
They have nets of different kinds for both fishing and
hunting. At night, as a light for their dwellings they
use torches made from palm-wood dipped in oil and
beeswax. The lords and principal men of the provinces
of Darien and Urabá are reputed to have drunk from
golden cups of rich and beautiful workmanship. Peter
Martyr gives an account of golden trumpets and a great
number of bells found by the Spaniards in a town situated
on the River Dabaiba (Atrato). The bells were
used at ceremonies and festivals, giving forth a sweet
and pleasant sound; the tongues or clappers were beautifully
made, of fish-bones. In another part of the
country, on the gulf of Urabá, says Peter Martyr, as
rendered by the ancient translator: "They founde also a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">766</a></span>
great multitude of shetes, made of the silke or cotton of
the gossampine tree; likewise diuers kindes of vessels
and tooles made of wood, and many of earth; also many
brest plates of gold, and ouches wrought after their manner."<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>They manufacture strong cords from the bark of the
mahoe-tree, which is taken off in long strips, beaten with
sticks, cleaned, and then twisted. A finer description
of thread is made from a species of pita, of which the
leaves undergo a somewhat similar process in preparation
as flax, being steeped in water for several days, then
dried in the sun and afterwards beaten, producing fine
silky threads, from which their hammocks and finer
kinds of nets for catching small fish are made. From
the same plant they make excellent baskets and matting;
the materials are first dyed in different colors,
prettily mixed and woven together so closely as to hold
water. They are of a soft texture and exceedingly durable.
The Dorachos are famed for the manufacture of
pottery, water-bottles, and other household utensils, elegantly
shaped and prettily painted. Cotton cloths are
woven by women, and considering the rude and simple
implements they work with, the fineness of texture and
blending of colors present a marvel of skill and patience.
The process of weaving is thus described by Wafer:
"The Women make a Roller of Wood, about three Foot
long, turning easily about between two Posts. About
this they place Strings of Cotton, of 3 or 4 yards long,
at most, but oftner less, according to the use the Cloth
is to be put to, whether for a Hammock, or to tie about
their Waists, or for Gowns, or for Blankets to cover
them in their Hammocks, as they lie in them in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">767</a></span>
Houses; which are all the Uses they have for Cloth:
And they never weave a piece of Cotton with a design
to cut it, but of a size that shall just serve for the particular
use. The Threads thus coming from the Roller are
the Warp; and for the Woof, they twist Cotton-yarn
about a small piece of <i>Macaw</i>-wood, notch'd at each end;
And taking up every other Thread of the Warp with the
Fingers of one Hand, they put the Woof through with
the other Hand, and receive it out on the other side:
and to make the Threads of the Woof lie close in the
Cloth, they strike them at every turn with a long and
thin piece of <i>Macaw</i>-wood like a Ruler, which lies across
between the Threads of the Warp for that purpose."<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN BOATS AND NAVIGATION.</p>

<p>The canoes and rafts of the Isthmians are admirably
adapted to the navigation of their rivers and gulfs,
and the men who manage them are skillful boatmen.
The canoes vary in size; some are dug out from the
single trunk of a tree, others are constructed of bark.
The largest are thirty-five feet in length by three in
breadth, and are capable of carrying many persons, besides
a considerable amount of cargo. They are so lightly
built that little difficulty is experienced in passing them
over obstructions, and those of smaller size are often carried
on the head. They draw very little water, and are
propelled with paddles by two persons, one in the stern,
the other in the bow. When passing over rapids, palancas,
or poles, are used, with crotchets attached, which answer
the purpose of a boat-hook in laying hold of the bank
or overhanging branches of trees, where the depth of
water prevents the pole reaching the bottom. The rafts
are made from an exceedingly light and soft timber
similar to cork-wood. Three or four logs are bound together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">768</a></span>
with ropes and across them are laid smaller timbers
of the same wood, fastened down with hard wooden
pegs that are easily driven through. The rafts are chiefly
employed for fishing or crossing large rivers. Canoes
are, however, quite as frequently used for fishing purposes.<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p>The native products are gold, pearls, tortoise-shell,
ivory-nuts, cacao, caoutchouc, corozo-nuts, cocoa-nuts,
dried venison, lard, and deer-skins; these are offered in
considerable quantities to foreigners, and in exchange
they receive salt and ironware, besides various trinkets
and such domestic utensils as they are in need of. The
value of the pearls was lessened on account of their
practice of throwing oysters into the fire in order to
open them, which partially destroyed their lustre. The
natives of the coast carry into the interior dried fish and
salt, which they barter for gold dust and other products.
At Pueblo Nuevo sarsaparilla forms a principal article
of trade. The native traders are very shrewd, and as
a rule practice fair dealing. On his march through the
country, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa found the people in
possession of large quantities of gold, jewelry, and pearls.
Everywhere along his route he received presents of gold;
indeed, in some places he found this metal in greater
abundance than food.<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>The streams of this region are subject to frequent
swellings, caused by heavy rains. After the subsiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">769</a></span>
of these floods, the natives procure gold from the river-beds;
they also burn the grass in the mountains and
pick up the metal left exposed on the surface in large
quantities. In the district of Veragua and in Darien
they have workers in gold, crucibles for melting metals,
and implements of silversmiths. They understand the
alloying of gold, from which they make vases and many
kinds of ornaments in the shape of birds and different
varieties of animals. The relics which from time to
time have been exhumed in Chiriquí and other parts of
the Isthmus, prove that the natives had an excellent
knowledge of the art of working and also of sculpturing
in gold and stone. Painting and glazing on jars and
other descriptions of pottery was an art in which the
men of Chiriquí were famous.<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> The Isthmians possessed
only a very slight knowledge of the computation of time.
They calculate the hour of the day by the height
of the sun in the heavens, and have no division of time
into years, months, or weeks. Their enumeration is
limited to twenty, and beyond that they count by twenties
to one hundred; their knowledge of numbers does
not go further.<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ARTS AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>In the provinces of Cueba, Comagre, and other parts
of Darien the eldest son succeeded to the government
upon the death of his father. As soon as the funeral
ceremonies were over, the heir received the congratulations
of the attendant nobles, the highest and most aged
of whom conducted him to a chamber and laid him in a
hammock. His subjects then came to offer their submission
accompanied with presents, which consisted of
large stores of edibles and fruits of every kind. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">770</a></span>
greeted him with triumphal songs in which they recounted
the deeds of his ancestors, as well as those of
other lords of the land, telling him who were his friends
and who his enemies. Much wine was consumed and
the rejoicing lasted several days. Afterwards ambassadors
were dispatched to inform all the neighboring
caciques of the new accession, desiring their good will
and friendship for the future. In the province of Panamá
upon the death of the lord, the eldest brother succeeded
him, and if there were no brothers the succession
went to a nephew by the sister's side. The chiefs held undisputed
authority over their people and were implicitly
obeyed. They received no tribute but required personal
service for house-building, hunting, fishing, or tilling
the ground; men so employed were fed and maintained
by the chief. In Cueba the reigning lord was called
<i>quebi</i>, in other parts he was called <i>tiba</i>. The highest in
rank after the <i>tiba</i> had the title of <i>sacos</i>, who commanded
certain districts of the country. <i>Piraraylos</i> were nobles
who had become famous in war. Subject to the sacos
were the <i>cabras</i> who enjoyed certain lands and privileges
not accorded to the common people. Any one
wounded in battle, when fighting in presence of the <i>tiba</i>,
was made a cabra and his wife became an <i>espave</i> or
principal woman. A constable could not arrest or kill
a cabra; this could be done only by the tiba; once
struck by the tiba, however, any person might kill him,
for no sooner was he wounded by his chief than his
title and rank dropped from him. Constables were
appointed whose duty it was to arrest offenders and
execute judgment on the guilty. Justice was administered
without form by the chief in person who decided
all controversies. The cases must be stated truthfully,
as the penalty for false testimony was death. There
was no appeal from the decision of the chief. Theft
was punishable with death and anyone catching a thief
in flagrante delicto, might cut off the offender's hands
and hang them to his neck. Murder was also punished
by death; the penalty for adultery was death to both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">771</a></span>
parties. In Darien, he who defloured a virgin had a
brier thrust up his virile member, which generally
caused death. The facts had to be proved on oath, the
form of taking which was to swear by their tooth. As
I have said, a constable could not arrest or kill a noble;
consequently if one committed a crime punishable with
death, the chief must kill him with his own hand, and
notice was given to all the people by beating the large
war drum so that they should assemble and witness the
execution. The chief then in presence of the multitude
recited the offence, and the culprit acknowledged the
justice of the sentence. This duty fulfilled, the chief
struck the culprit two or three blows on the head with
a macana until he fell, and if he was not killed, any
one of the spectators gave him the finishing stroke.
Criminals who were executed were denied the right of
burial. The Caribs had no chiefs, every man obeyed
the dictates of his own passions, unrestrained by either
government or laws.<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PUNISHMENTS AND SLAVERY.</p>

<p>Slavery was in force among the various nations inhabiting
the Isthmus, and every principal man retained
a number of prisoners as bondsmen; they were called
<i>pacos</i>, and, as I have already mentioned, were branded
or tattooed with the particular mark of the owner on the
face or arm, or had one of their front teeth extracted.
When traveling, the slaves had to carry their lord's
effects, and a dozen or more were detailed to carry his
litter or hammock, which was slung on a pole and borne
on the shoulders of two men at a time, who were relieved
at intervals by two others, the change being made without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">772</a></span>
stopping. On his march across the Isthmus in 1513,
Vasco Nuñez found some negro slaves belonging to the
cacique of Quarecas, but the owner could give no information
relative to them, except that there were more of
that color near the place, with whom they were continually
at war.<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FAMILY RELATIONS OF THE ISTHMIANS.</p>

<p>Caciques and lords married as many wives as they
pleased. The marriage of the first wife was celebrated
with a great banquet, at the close of which the bride
was handed over to her husband. Subsequent wives
were not married with ceremonies or rejoicings, but took
the place of concubines, and were subject to the orders
of the first wife. The number of wives was limited
only by the wealth of the lord. Vasco Nuñez took prisoner
the cacique Tumanamá with all his family, among
which were eighty wives. The children of the first wife
were legitimate, while those of others were bastards and
could not inherit. Marriage was not contracted with
strangers or people speaking a different language, and
the tiba and lords only married with the daughters of
noble blood. Divorces were brought about by mutual
consent and for slight causes, and sometimes wives were
exchanged. If a woman was barren, they promptly
agreed upon a separation, which took place when the
woman had her menstrual period, in order that there
might be no suspicion of pregnancy. When a maiden
reached the age of puberty, she was kept shut up, sometimes
for a period of two years. In some parts of Darien,
when a contract of marriage was made, all the
neighbors brought presents of maize or fruits, and laid
them at the door of the bride's father; when the offerings
were all made, each one of the company was given
a calabash of liquor; then followed speeches and dancing,
and the bridegroom's father presented his son to the
bride, and joined their hands; after which the bride
was returned to her father, who kept her shut up in a
house with him for seven days. During that time all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">773</a></span>
the friends assisted in clearing a plantation and building
a house for the couple, while the women and children
planted the ground. The seven days having
elapsed, another merrymaking took place, at which much
liquor was drunk. The bridegroom took the precaution
to put away all weapons which were hung to the ridge-pole
of his house, in order to prevent any serious fighting
during their drunken orgies, which lasted several
days, or until all the liquor was consumed. If a man had
several wives, he often kept each one in a separate
house, though sometimes they all lived together; a
woman who was pregnant always occupied a house to
herself.<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Women are easily delivered, and the young
infant is tied to a board on its back or between two
pillows, and is kept so confined until able to walk, the
board being removed only to wash the child. Male
children are early accustomed to the use of weapons, and
when able to carry a few provisions for themselves, they
accompany their fathers on hunting expeditions. Girls
are brought up to household duties, cooking, weaving,
and spinning. Prostitution was not infamous; noble
ladies held as a maxim, that it was plebeian to deny anything
asked of them, and they gave themselves up to
any person that wooed them, willingly, especially to
principal men. This tendency to licentiousness carried
with it extremes in the use of abortives whereby to
avoid the consequence of illicit pleasures, as well that
they might not be deprived of them, as to keep their
breasts from softening; for, said they, old women should
bear children, not young ones, who have to amuse themselves.
Sodomy was practiced by the nations of Cueba,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">774</a></span>
Careta, and other places. The caciques and some of
the head men kept harems of youths, who, as soon as
destined to the unclean office, were dressed as women,
did women's work about the house, and were exempt
from war and its fatigues. They went by the name of
<i>camayoas</i>, and were hated and detested by the women.<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">INTOXICATING LIQUORS.</p>

<p>Their public amusements were called <i>areitos</i>, a species
of dance very nearly resembling some in the northern
provinces of Spain. They took place upon occasions of
a marriage or birth, or when they were about to go forth
on a hunting expedition, or at the time of harvest.
One led the singing, stepping to the measure, and the
rest followed, imitating the leader. Others again engaged
in feats of arms and sham battles, while singers
and improvisatori related the deeds of their ancestors
and historical events of the nation. The men indulged
freely in fermented liquors and wines, the drinking and
dancing lasting many hours and sometimes whole days,
until drunk and exhausted they fell to the ground.
Actors in appropriate costumes counterfeited the various
pursuits of fishing, hunting, and agriculture, while others,
in the guise of jesters and fools, assisted in enlivening
the scene. Their principal musical instruments
were drums and small whistles made of reeds; they had
also javelins with holes pierced in them near the end,
so that when cast into the air a loud whistling noise was
produced.<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> They have various kinds of wines and
liquors both sweet and sour. One is obtained from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">775</a></span>
species of palm-tree, by tapping the trunk near the top,
and inserting a leaf into the cut. The liquor drawn off
soon ferments, and in two or three days is fit to drink;
or it is boiled with water and mixed with spices.
Another kind called <i>chicha</i> is made from maize; a quantity
of the grain is soaked in water, then taken out and
left to sprout, when it is bruised and placed in a large
vessel filled with water, where it is allowed to remain
until it begins to turn sour. A number of old women
then collect and chew some of the grain, which they
spit out into large gourds until they have a sufficient
quantity; this, as soon as it ferments, is added to the
water in the vessel, and in a short time the whole undergoes
fermentation. When the liquor is done working it
is drawn off from the sediment, and a strongly intoxicating
liquor is thus produced, which is their favorite
beverage. They have another method of making chicha,
by boiling the sprouted grain in water till the quantity
is considerably reduced; it is then removed from the
fire and left to settle and cool. In two days it becomes
clear and fit to drink, but after five or six days it begins
to acidify so that only a moderate quantity is made at
a time. Different varieties of wines and liquors are
made from dates, bananas, pineapples, and other fruits,
and we are told that the first Spanish explorers of the
country found large quantities of fermented liquors
buried beneath the ground under their house-tree, because
if stored in their houses the liquor became turbid
from constant agitation. The cellar of the king Comagre
is described as being filled with great vessels of
earth and wood, containing wine and cider. Peter Martyr,
in his account of the visit of Vasco Nuñez and his
company to the king, says "they drunke wines of sundry
tastes both white and black." Tobacco is much
used by the Isthmians; the natives of Costa Rica roll
the leaf up in the form of a cigar, and tie it with grass
threads; they inhale the smoke, and, retaining it for a
short time, pass it out through the mouth and nostrils.
The cigar used by the natives of the isthmus of Panamá
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">776</a></span>
is much larger. Mr Wafer thus describes their manner
of making and smoking it: "Laying two or three Leaves
upon one another, they roll up all together side-ways
into a long Roll, yet leaving a little hollow. Round this
they roll other Leaves one after another, in the same
manner but close and hard, till the Roll be as big as ones
Wrist, and two or three Feet in length. Their way of
Smoaking when they are in Company together is thus:
A Boy lights one end of a Roll and burns it to a Coal,
wetting the part next it to keep it from wasting too fast.
The End so lighted he puts into his Mouth, and blows
the Smoak through the whole length of the Roll into
the Face of every one of the Company or Council, tho'
there be 2 or 300 of them. Then they, sitting in their
usual Posture upon Forms, make, with their Hands
held hollow together, a kind of Funnel round their
Mouths and Noses. Into this they receive the Smoak
as 'tis blown upon them, snuffing it up greedily and
strongly as long as ever they are able to hold their
Breath, and seeming to bless themselves, as it were, with
the Refreshment it gives them." After eating heartily,
more especially after supper, they burn certain gums
and herbs and fumigate themselves to produce sleep.<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>The Isthmians are good walkers, their tread firm, but
light and soft as a cat, and they are exceedingly active
in all their movements. When traveling they are
guided by the sun, or ascertain their course by observing
the bark of the trees; the bark on the south side
being always the thickest. When fatigued by travel
they scarify their legs with a sharpened reed or snakes'
teeth. They are very expert swimmers and the dwellers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">777</a></span>
on the coast pass much of their time in the water.
In salutation they turn their backs to each other. No
one will accept a gift from a stranger unless with the
especial permission of the chief.<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN SORCERERS.</p>

<p>They believe largely in spirits and divinations, and
have sorcerers called <i>piaces</i> who are held in much respect
and awe. The piaces profess to have the power
of foretelling the future and raising spirits. When
putting in practice their arts they retire to a solitary
place, or shut themselves up in a house, where, with
loud cries and unearthly sounds they pretend to consult
the oracle. Boys destined to be piaces are taken at the
age of ten or twelve years to be instructed in the office;
they are selected for the natural inclination or the
peculiar aptitude and intelligence which they display
for the service. Those so chosen are confined in a solitary
place where they dwell in company with their instructors.
For two years they are subjected to severe
discipline, they must not eat flesh nor anything having
life, but live solely on vegetables, drink only water, and
not indulge in sexual intercourse. During the probationary
term neither parents nor friends are permitted to
see them; at night only are they visited by professional
masters, who instruct them in the mysteries of the
necromantic arts. In the province of Cueba masters in
these arts are called <i>tequinas</i>. It is asserted of the piaces
that they could foretell an eclipse of the moon three
months before the time. The people were much troubled
with witches, who were supposed to hold converse with
evil spirits, and inflicted many ills especially upon children.<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">778</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICAL PRACTICE.</p>

<p>The Isthmians are a healthful and long-lived race.
The ills most common to them are fevers and venereal
disease. The latter, as Oviedo affirms, was introduced
into Europe from Hayti, or Española, where it was prevalent
as well as throughout Tierra Firme. This is a subject
that has given rise to much contention among
authors, but the balance of testimony seems to indicate
that the venereal disease in Europe was not of American
origin, although the disease probably existed in America
before the coming of Europeans. The remedies employed
by the Isthmians for the complaint were <i>guayacan</i>
wood, and other medicinal herbs known to
them. They are much troubled with a minute species
of tick-lice that cover their limbs in great numbers,
from which they endeavor to free themselves by applying
burning straw. Another insect, more serious in its
consequences and penetrating in its attacks, is the <i>chegoe</i>,
or <i>pulex penetrans</i>; it burrows under the skin, where it
lays its eggs, and if not extracted will in time increase
to such an extent as to endanger the loss of the limb.
The natives remove it with any sharp-pointed instrument.
They are liable to be bitten by venomous snakes,
which are numerous in the country and frequently cause
death. Whenever one is bitten by such a reptile, the
sufferer immediately ties above the wounded part a
ligature made from plants well known to the natives,
and which they usually carry with them; this enables
him to reach a village, where he procures assistance, and
by means of herbal applications is often cured. Some
of them are subject to a skin disease somewhat similar
in its appearance to ringworm; it spreads over the whole
body until eventually the skin peels off. Those who are
thus afflicted are called <i>carates</i>. These people are generally
very hardy and strong, with great powers of endurance.
The piaces, as medicine-men, consult their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">779</a></span>
oracles for the benefit of all those who require their
services. The sucking cure obtains in these parts as
well as northward. When summoned to attend a patient,
if the pain or disease is slight, the medicine-man
takes some herbs in his mouth, and applying his lips to
the part affected, pretends to suck out the disorder; suddenly
he rushes outside with cheeks extended, and feigns
to spit out something, cursing and imprecating at the
same time; he then assures his patient that he has
effected a cure by extracting the cause of the pain.
When the sickness is of a more serious nature, more
elaborate enchantments are enacted, ending in the practitioner
sucking it out from the sick person's body, not,
however, without undergoing infinite trouble, labor, and
contortions, till at last the piace thrusts a small stick
down his own throat, which causes him to vomit, and so
he casts up that which he pretends to have drawn out
from the sufferer. Should his conjurations and tricks
not prove effectual, the physician brings to his aid certain
herbs and decoctions, with which he is well
acquainted; their knowledge of medicine is, however,
more extensive in the treatment of external than of
internal diseases. The compensation given to the piace
is in proportion to the gravity of the case, and the
ability of the individual to reward him. In cases of
fever, bleeding is resorted to; their mode of practicing
phlebotomy is peculiar and attended with much unnecessary
suffering. The operator shoots a small arrow from
a bow into various parts of the patient's body until a
vein be accidentally opened; the arrow is gauged a short
distance from the point to prevent its penetrating too
far.<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> Oviedo tells us that in the province of Cueba the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">780</a></span>
practice of sucking was carried on to a fearful extent,
and with dire consequences. The persons, men and
women, who indulged in the habit were called by the
Spaniards <i>chupadores</i>. They belonged to a class of sorcerers,
and the historian says they went about at night
visiting certain of the inhabitants, whom they sucked for
hours, continuing the practice from day to day, until
finally the unfortunate recipients of their attentions became
so thin and emaciated that they often died from
exhaustion.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN GRAVES AND MOURNING.</p>

<p>Among certain nations of Costa Rica when a death
occurs the body is deposited in a small hut constructed
of plaited palm-leaves; food, drink, as well as the weapons
and implements that served the defunct during life
are placed in the same hut. Here the body is preserved
for three years, and upon each anniversary of the death
it is redressed and attended to amidst certain ceremonies.
At the end of the third year it is taken out and
interred. Among other tribes in the same district, the
corpse after death is covered with leaves and surrounded
with a large pile of wood which is set on fire, the friends
dancing and singing round the flames until all is consumed,
when the ashes are collected and buried in the ground.
In Veragua the Dorachos had two kinds of
tombs, one for the principal men constructed with flat
stones laid together with much care, and in which were
placed costly jars and urns filled with food and wines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">781</a></span>
for the dead; those for plebeians were merely trenches,
in which were deposited with the occupant some gourds
<span class="sidenote">FUNERAL RITES ON THE ISTHMUS.</span>
of maize and wine and the place filled with stones. In
some parts of Panamá and Darien only the chiefs and
lords received funeral rites. Among the common people
a person feeling his end approaching either went himself
or was led to the woods by his wife, family, and friends,
who, supplying him with some cake or ears of corn and
a gourd of water, there left him to die alone, or to be
assisted by wild beasts. Others with more respect for
their dead, buried them in sepulchres made with niches
where they placed maize and wine and renewed the
same annually. With some, a mother dying while suckling
her infant, the living child was placed at her breast
and buried with her in order that in her future state
she might continue to nourish it with her milk. In
some provinces when the cacique became sick, the
priests consulted their oracles as to his condition and if
they received for answer that the illness was mortal, one
half of his jewelry and gold was cast into the river as a
sacrifice to the god they reverenced, in the belief that
he would guide him to his final rest; the other half was
buried in the grave. The relatives of the deceased
shaved the head as a sign of mourning and all his weapons
and other property were consumed by fire in order
that nothing should remain as a remembrance of him. In
Panamá, Nata, and some other districts, when a cacique
died, those of his concubines that loved him enough,
those that he loved ardently and so appointed, as well
as certain servants, killed themselves and were interred
with him. This they did in order that they might wait
upon him in the land of spirits. They held the belief
that those who did not accompany him then, would,
when they died a natural death, lose the privilege of
being with him afterwards, and in fact that their souls
would die with them. The privilege of attending on
the cacique in his future state was believed to be only
granted to those who were in his service during his lifetime,
hence such service was eagerly sought after by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">782</a></span>
natives of both sexes, who made every exertion to be
admitted as servants in his house. At the time of the
interment, those who planted corn for him during his
lifetime had some maize and an implement of husbandry
buried with them in order that they might commence
planting immediately on arrival in the other world. In
Comagre and other provinces the bodies of the caciques
were embalmed by placing them on a cane hurdle,
hanging them up by cords, or placing them on a stone,
or log; and round or below the body they made a slow
fire of herbs at such a distance as to dry it gradually
until only skin and bone remained. During the process
of embalming, twelve of the principal men sat round the
body, dressed in black mantles which covered their heads,
letting them hang down to their feet; at intervals one
of them beat a drum and when he ceased he chanted
in monotonous tones, the others responding. Day and
night the twelve kept watch and never left the body.
When sufficiently dried it was dressed and adorned with
many ornaments of gold, jewels, and feathers, and set
up in an apartment of the palace where were kept
ranged round the walls the remains of his ancestors,
each one in his place and in regular succession. In
case a cacique fell in battle and his body could not be
recovered, or was otherwise lost, the place he would
have occupied in the row was always left vacant.
Among other tribes the body after being dried by fire
was wrapped in several folds of cloth, put in a hammock,
and placed upon a platform in the air or in
a room. The manner in which the wives, attendants,
and servants put themselves to death was, with some,
by poison; in such case, the multitude assembled to
chant the praises of their dead lord, when those who were
to follow drank poison from gourds, and dropped dead
instantly. In some cases they first killed their children.
With others the funeral obsequies of a principal chief
were conducted differently. They prepared a large
grave twelve or fifteen feet square and nine or ten feet
deep; round the sides they built a stone bench and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">783</a></span>
covered it with painted cloth; in the middle of the grave
they placed jars and gourds filled with maize, fruit, and
wines, and a quantity of flowers. On the bench was
laid the dead chief dressed, ornamented, and jeweled,
while around him sat his wives gaily attired with ear-rings
and bracelets. All being prepared the assembled
multitude raised their voices in songs declaring the
bravery and prowess of the deceased; they recounted his
liberality and many virtues and highly extolled the
affection of his faithful wives who desired to accompany
him. The singing and dancing usually lasted two days
and during its continuance wine was freely served to the
performers and also to the women who were awaiting
their fate. At the expiration of such time they became
entirely inebriated and in a senseless condition, when
the final act was consummated by throwing dead and
doomed into the grave, and filling it with logs, branches,
and earth. The spot was afterwards held in sacred
remembrance and a grove of trees planted round it.
At the end of a year funeral honors were celebrated in
memory of the dead. A host of friends and relatives
of equal rank with the deceased were invited to participate,
who upon the day appointed brought quantities of
food and wine such as he whose memory they honored
delighted in, also weapons with which he used to fight,
all of which were placed in a canoe prepared for the
purpose; in it was also deposited an effigy of the deceased.
The canoe was then carried on men's shoulders
round the court of the palace or house, in presence of
the deceased, if he was embalmed, and afterwards
brought out to the centre of the town where it was
burned with all it contained,&mdash;the people believing that
the fumes and smoke ascended to the soul of the dead
and was pleasing and acceptable to him.<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> If the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">784</a></span>
had been interred they opened the sepulchre; all the
people with hair disheveled uttering loud lamenting
cries while the bones were being collected, and these
they burned all except the hinder part of the skull,
which was taken home by one of the principal women
and preserved by her as a sacred relic.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ISTHMIAN CHARACTER.</p>

<p>The character of the Costa Ricans has ever been that
of a fierce and savage people, prominent in which qualities
are the Guatusos and Buricas, who have shown
themselves strongly averse to intercourse with civilization.
The Talamancas are a little less untameable,
which is the best, or perhaps the worst, that can be said.
The Terrabas, also a cruel and warlike nation, are nevertheless
spoken of by Fray Juan Domingo Arricivita
as endowed with natural docility. The natives of Boca
del Toro are barbarous and averse to change. In Chiriquí
they are brave and intelligent, their exceeding
courage having obtained for them the name of <i>Valientes</i>
or <i>Indios Bravos</i> from the early discoverers; they are
also noted for honesty and fair dealing. The same warlike
and independent spirit and fearlessness of death prevails
among the nations of Veragua, Panamá, and
Darien. The inhabitants of Panamá and Cueba are
given to lechery, theft, and lying; with some these qualities
are fashionable; others hold them to be crimes.
The Mandingos and natives of San Blas are an independent
and industrious people, possessing considerable
intelligence, and are of a docile and hospitable disposition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">785</a></span>
The inhabitants of Darien are kind, open-hearted,
and peaceable, yet have always been resolute in opposing
all interference from foreigners; they are fond of
amusements and inclined to indolence; the latter trait
is not, however, applicable to all, a noticeable exception
being the Cunas and Chocos of the Atrato Valley, who
are of a gentle nature, kind, hospitable, and open-hearted
when once their confidence is gained; they are
likewise industrious and patient, and M. Lucien de Puydt
says of the former: "Theft is altogether unknown
amongst the Cunas." Colonel Alcedo, speaking of their
neighbors, the Idibaes, calls them treacherous, inconstant,
and false. In the interior and mountain districts
the inhabitants are more fierce than those from the coast;
the former are shy and retiring, yet given to hospitality.
On the gulf of Urabá the people are warlike, vainglorious,
and revengeful.<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Thus from the icy regions of the north to the hot and
humid shores of Darien I have followed these Wild
Tribes of the Pacific States, with no other object in
view than faithfully to picture them according to the
information I have been able to glean. And thus I
leave them, yet not without regret: for notwithstanding
all that has been said I cannot but feel how little we
know of them. Of their mighty unrecorded past, their
interminable intermixtures, their ages of wars and convulsions,
their inner life, their aspirations, hopes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">786</a></span>
fears, how little do we know of all this! And now as
the eye rests upon the fair domain from which they
have been so ignobly hurried, questions like these arise:
How long have these backings and battlings been going
on? What purpose did these peoples serve? Whence
did they come and whither have they gone?&mdash;questions
unanswerable until Omniscience be fathomed and the
beginning and end made one.</p>

between the Western and Eastern Lacandónes. All the country lying on the

<p>The <i>Mames</i> 'occupied the existing district of Güegüetenango, a part of
Quezaltenango, and the province of Soconusco, and in all these places the
Mam or Pocoman language is vernacular. It is a circumstance not a
little remarkable, that this idiom is also peculiar to places very distant
from the country of the Mams: viz. in Amatitan, Mixco, and Petapa, in
the province of Sacatepeques; Chalchuapa, in St. Salvador; Mita, Jalapa,
and Xilotepeque, in Chiquimula.' <i>Juarros' Hist. Guat.</i>, p. 169. 'El Mame

souverainement cette contrée, alors désignée sous le nom commun d'Otzoya
(de otzoy, sortes d'écrevisses d'or): c'étaient d'un côté les Chun-Zak-Yoc,
qui avaient pour capitale Qulaha, que son opulence et son étendue avaient
fait surnommer Nima-Amag ou la Grande-Ville, dite depuis Xelahun-Quieh,
ou Xelahuh, et Quezaltenango; les Tzitzol, dont la capitale était peut-être
Chinabahul ou Huehuetenango, les Ganchebi (see note below under Ganchebis)

<p>Brasseur de Bourbourg describes quite a number of very ancient
nations, of some of which he endeavors to fix the localities, and which
I insert here. Dan or Tamub founded a monarchy on the Guatemalan
plateau. Their 'capitale, Amag-Dan, existait, suivant toute apparence,

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Of late, custom gives to the main land of Russian America, the name <i>Alaska</i>;
to the peninsula, <i>Aliaska</i>; and to a large island of the Aleutian Archipelago,
<i>Unalashka</i>. The word of which the present name Alaska is a corruption, is
first encountered in the narrative of Betsevin, who, in 1761, wintered on the
peninsula, supposing it to be an island. The author of <i>Neue Nachrichten von
denen neuentdekten Insuln</i>, writes, page 53, 'womit man nach der abgelegensten
Insul <i>Aläksu</i> oder <i>Alachschak</i> über gieng.' Again, at page 57, in giving
a description of the animals on the supposed island he calls it 'auf der Insul
<i>Aläsku</i>.' 'This,' says Coxe, <i>Russian Discoveries</i>, p. 72, 'is probably the same
island which is laid down in Krenitzin's chart under the name of <i>Alaxa</i>.'
<i>Unalaschka</i> is given by the author of <i>Neue Nachrichten</i>, p. 74, in his narrative
of the voyage of Drusinin, who hunted on that island in 1763. At page
115 he again mentions the 'grosse Insul <i>Aläksu</i>.' On page 125, in Glottoff's
log-book, 1764, is the entry: 'Den 28sten May der Wind Ostsüdost; man kam
an die Insul <i>Alaska</i> oder <i>Aläksu</i>.' Still following the author of <i>Neue Nachrichten</i>,
we have on page 166, in an account of the voyages of Otseredin and
Popoff, who hunted upon the Aleutian Islands in 1769, mention of a report
by the natives 'that beyond Unimak is said to be a large land <i>Aläschka</i>, the
extent of which the islanders do not know.' On Cook's Atlas, voyage 1778,
the peninsula is called <i>Alaska</i>, and the island <i>Oonalaska</i>, La Pérouse, in his
atlas, map No. 15, 1786, calls the peninsula <i>Alaska</i>, and the island <i>Ounalaska</i>.
The Spaniards, in the <i>Atlas para el Viage de las goletas Sutil y Mexicana</i>,
1792, write <i>Alasca</i> for the peninsula, and for the island <i>Unalaska</i>. Sauer, in
his account of Billings' expedition, 1790, calls the main land <i>Alaska</i>, the
peninsula <i>Alyaska</i>, and the island <i>Oonalashka</i>. Wrangell, in <i>Baer's Statistische
und ethnographische Nachrichten</i>, p. 123, writes for the peninsula <i>Alaska</i>
and for the island <i>Unalaschka</i>. Holmberg, <i>Ethnographische Skizzen</i>, p. 78,
calls the island <i>Unalaschka</i> and the peninsula <i>Aljaska</i>. Dall, <i>Alaska</i>, p. 529,
says that the peninsula or main land was called by the natives <i>Alayeksa</i>,
and the island <i>Nagun-alayeksa</i>, 'or the land near Alayeksa.' Thus we
have, from which to choose, the orthography of the earliest voyagers to this
coast&mdash;Russian, English, French, Spanish, German, and American. The
simple word <i>Alaksu</i>, after undergoing many contortions, some authors writing
it differently on different pages of the same book, has at length become
<i>Alaska</i>, as applied to the main land; <i>Aliaska</i> for the peninsula, and <i>Unalashka</i>
as the name of the island. As these names are all corruptions from
some one original word, whatever that may be, I see no reason for giving
the error three different forms. I therefore write Alaska for the mainland
and peninsula and Unalaska for the island.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The name is said, by Charlevoix 'to be derived from the language of the
Abenaqui, a tribe of Algonquins in Canada, who border upon them and call
them "Esquimantsic."' 'L'origine de leur nom n'est pas certain. Toutefois
il y a bien de l'apparence qu'il vient du mot Abenaqui, <i>esquimantsic</i> qui veut
dire "mangeur de viande cruë."' See <i>Prichard's Physical History of Mankind</i>,
vol. v., pp. 367, 373. 'French writers call them Eskimaux.' 'English
authors, in adopting this term, have most generally written it "Esquimaux,"
but Dr. Latham, and other recent ethnologists, write it "Eskimos," after
the Danish orthography.' <i>Richardson's Polar Regions</i>, p. 298. 'Probably of
Canadian origin, and the word, which in French orthography is written Esquimaux,
was probably originally <i>Ceux qui miaux</i> (<i>miaulent</i>).' <i>Richardson's
Journal</i>, vol. i., p. 340. 'Said to be a corruption of <i>Eskimantik</i>, <i>i. e.</i> raw-fish-eaters,
a nickname given them by their former neighbors, the Mohicans.'
<i>Seemann's Voyage of the Herald</i>, vol. ii., p. 49. Eskimo is derived from a
word indicating sorcerer or Shamán. 'The northern Tinneh use the word
<i>Uskeemi</i>.' <i>Dall's Alaska</i>, pp. 144, 531. 'Their own national designation is
"Keralit."' <i>Morton's Crania Americana</i>, p. 52. They 'call themselves "Innuit,"
which signifies "man."' <i>Armstrong's Narrative</i>, p. 191.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It is not without reluctance that I change a word from the commonly
accepted orthography. Names of places, though originating in error, when
once established, it is better to leave unchanged. Indian names, coming to
us through Russian, German, French, or Spanish writers, should be presented
in English by such letters as will best produce the original Indian pronunciation.
European personal names, however, no matter how long, nor
how commonly they may have been erroneously used, should be immediately
corrected. Every man who can spell is supposed to be able to give the
correct orthography of his own name, and his spelling should in every
instance be followed, when it can be ascertained. Veit Bering, anglicè Vitus
Behring, was of a Danish family, several members of which were well known in
literature before his own time. In Danish writings, as well as among the biographies
of Russian admirals, where may be found a fac-simile of his autograph,
the name is spelled <i>Bering</i>. It is so given by Humboldt, and by the <i>Dictionnaire
de la Conversation</i>. The author of the <i>Neue Nachrichten von denen neuentdekten
Insuln</i>, one of the oldest printed works on Russian discoveries in America;
as well as Müller, who was the companion of Bering for many years; and
Buschmann,&mdash;all write <i>Bering</i>. Baer remarks: 'Ich schreibe ferner Bering,
obgleich es jetzt fast allgemein geworden ist, Behring zu schreiben, und auch
die Engländer und Franzosen sich der letztern Schreibart bequemt haben.
Bering war ein Däne und seine Familie war lange vor ihm in der Literatur-Geschichte
bekannt. Sie hat ihren Namen auf die von mir angenommene
Weise drucken lassen. Derselben Schreibart bediente sich auch der Historiograph
Müller, der längere Zeit unter seinen Befehlen gedient hatte, und
Pallas.' <i>Statistische und ethnographische Nachrichten</i>, p. 328. There is no
doubt that the famous navigator wrote his name <i>Bering</i>, and that the letter
'h' was subsequently inserted to give the Danish sound to the letter 'e.'
To accomplish the same purpose, perhaps, Coxe, Langsdorff, Beechey, and
others write <i>Beering</i>.</p>

denoting a supposed original North American race&mdash;is absurdly used to denote
all the tribes which inhabit the Rocky Mountains and the western coast
of North America, from California inclusively to the regions inhabited by the
Esquimaux. In this great tract there are more tribes, differing totally in language
and customs, than in any other portion of the American continent;
and surely a better general name for them could be found than this meaningless

Mr Sproat suggests no other name. It is quite possible that Cook, <i>Voy. to
the Pacific</i>, vol. ii., p. 288, misunderstood the native name of Nootka Sound.
It is easy to criticise any name which might be adopted, and even if it were
practicable or desirable to change all meaningless and misapplied geographical

'Their houses are neatly constructed, standing in a row; having large images,

observed several oblong squares, of about twenty feet by eight. They were
made of thick cedar boards, which were joined with so much neatness, that
I at first thought they were one piece. They were painted with hieroglyphics,
and figures of different animals,' probably for purposes of devotion, as
was 'a large building in the middle of the village.... The ground-plot was
fifty feet by forty-five; each end is formed by four stout posts, fixed perpendicularly
in the ground. The corner ones are plain, and support a beam of the
whole length, having three intermediate props on each side, but of a larger
size, and eight or nine feet in height. The two centre posts, at each end, are
two and a half feet in diameter, and carved into human figures, supporting
two ridge poles on their heads, twelve feet from the ground. The figures at
the upper part of this square represent two persons, with their hands upon
their knees, as if they supported the weight with pain and difficulty: the
others opposite to them stand at their ease, with their hands resting on their
hips.... Posts, poles, and figures, were painted red and black, but the sculpture
of these people is superior to their painting.' <i>Mackenzie's Voy.</i>, p. 331.

Europe' is into the Quoquoulth (Quackoll) or Fort Rupert, in the north and
north-east; the Kowitchan, or Thongeith, on the east and south; Aht on the
west coast; and Komux, a distinct tribe also on the east of Vancouver.
'These tribes of the Ahts are not confederated; and I have no other warrant
for calling them a nation than the fact of their occupying adjacent territories,
and having the same superstitions and language.' <i>Sproat's Scenes</i>, pp. 18-19,
311. Mayne makes by language four nations; the first including the Cowitchen
in the harbor and valley of the same name north of Victoria, with the
Nanaimo and Kwantlum Indians about the mouth of the Fraser River, and
the Songhies; the second comprising the Comoux, Nanoose, Nimpkish, Quawguult,
etc., on Vancouver, and the Squawmisht, Sechelt, Clahoose, Ucle-tah,
Mama-lil-a-culla, etc., on the main, and islands, between Nanaimo and Fort
Rupert; the third and fourth groups include the twenty-four west-coast tribes
who speak two distinct languages, not named. <i>Mayne's Vanc. Isl.</i>, pp. 243-51.
Grant's division gives four languages on Vancouver, viz., the Quackoll, from
Clayoquot Sound north to C. Scott, and thence S. to Johnson's Strait; the
Cowitchin, from Johnson's Strait to Sanetch Arm; the Tsclallum, or Clellum,
from Sanetch to Soke, and on the opposite American shore; and the
Macaw, from Patcheena to Clayoquot Sound. 'These four principal languages
... are totally distinct from each other, both in sound, formation,
and modes of expression.' <i>Grant</i>, in <i>Lond. Geog. Soc., Jour.</i>, vol. xxvii., p. 295.
Scouler attempts no division into nations or languages. <i>Lond. Geo. Soc., Jour.</i>,
vol. xi., pp. 221, 224. Mofras singularly designates them as one nation of
20,000 souls, under the name of <i>Ouakich</i>. <i>Mofras</i>, <i>Explor.</i>, tom. ii., p. 343.
Recent investigations have shown a somewhat different relationship of these
languages, which I shall give more particularly in a subsequent volume.</p>

who have principally been in intercourse with the white man, have found it

The skull is fairly shaped, the eyes small and long, deep set, in colour a

of the face is oval; the features are tolerably regular, the lips being thin and

the nose flattening at the base, wide nostrils and a rounded point ... forehead
low; eyes small, black and languishing; mouth round, with large, round,

usually called Yakamas.' The name signifies 'Stony Ground.' <i>Gibbs</i>, in <i>Pandosy's

is "the Mouse country."' <i>Id.</i> The Yakima valley is a great national rendezvous
for these and surrounding nations. <i>Ross' Fur Hunters</i>, vol. i., pp. 19,
21. Kliketats, meaning robbers, was first the name given to the Whulwhypums,
and then extended to all speaking the same language. For twenty-five
years before 1854 they overran the Willamette Valley, but at that time were
forced by government to retire to their own country. <i>Tolmie</i>, in <i>Lord's Nat.</i>,

from the fact that formerly one of their chiefs, his wife having died,
spent much of his time in making cavities or basins in the soft rock for his
children to fill with water and pebbles, and thereby amuse themselves. <i>Victor's
All over Ogn.</i>, pp. 94-5. The word Cayuse is perhaps the French <i>Cailloux</i>,
'pebbles.' Called by Tolmie, 'Wyeilats or Kyoose.' He says their

for a successful season. The fish are cut open, dried on poles over a small
fire, and packed in bales. On the Fraser each family or village fishes for
itself; near the mouth large gaff-hooks are used, higher up a net managed
between two canoes. All the principal Indian fishing-stations on the Fraser
are below Fort Hope. For sturgeon a spear seventy to eighty feet long is
used. Cut of sturgeon-fishing. <i>Lord's Nat.</i>, vol. i., pp. 71-6, 181, 184-6. The

are the finest on the river.' The Yakima weirs constructed 'upon horizontal
spars, and supported by tripods of strong poles erected at short distances
apart; two of the logs fronting up stream, and one supporting them below;'
some fifty or sixty yards long. The salmon of the Okanagan were 'of a small
species, which had assumed a uniform red color.' 'The fishery at the Kettle
Falls is one of the most important on the river, and the arrangements of
the Indians in the shape of drying-scaffolds and store-houses are on a corresponding

with barbed iron points, fitted loosely by sockets to the ends of poles about
eight feet long,' to which they are fastened by a thong about twelve feet
long. <i>Abbott</i>, in <i>Pac. R. R. Rept.</i>, vol. vi., p. 90. On the upper Columbia an
Indian 'cut off a bit of his leathern shirt, about the size of a small bean;

husband and wife, but more particularly by the latter.' Wives live at different
camps among their relatives; one or two being constantly with the
husband. Brawls constantly occur when several wives meet. The women
are chaste, and attached to husband and children. At the age of fourteen
or fifteen the young man pays his addresses in person to the object of his
love, aged eleven or twelve. After the old folks are in bed, he goes to her
wigwam, builds a fire, and if welcome the mother permits the girl to come
and sit with him for a short time. These visits are several times repeated,
and he finally goes in the day-time with friends and his purchase money.

On the Columbia below the Snake was a shed-tomb sixty by twelve feet, open
at the ends, standing east and west. Recently dead bodies wrapped in leather
and arranged on boards at the west end. About the centre a promiscuous
heap of partially decayed corpses; and at eastern end a mat with twenty-one
skulls arranged in a circle. Articles of property suspended on the inside
and skeletons of horses scattered outside. About the Dalles eight vaults of

lodge torn down. Then alternate mourning and silence, and the deceased is
buried in a sitting posture in a round hole. Widows must mourn two years,

sometimes none, and only names for separate villages; sometimes a name for
a whole tribe or family, to which is prefixed a separate word for each dialect,
which is generally co-extensive with some valley. Of the first, an instance
is found in the Cahrocs, on the Klamath, who are a compact tribe, with no
dialects; of the second, in the large tribe on the lower Klamath, who have also
no dialects, and yet have no name, except for each village; of the third, in the
great family of the Pomos on Russian river, who have many dialects, and a
name for each,&mdash;as Ballo Ki Pomos, Cahto Pomos, etc.... Some remnants
of tribes have three or four names, all in use within a radius of that number

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_432" id="Footnote_432" href="#FNanchor_432"><span class="label">[432]</span></a> Mr. Gibbs, speaking of the tribes seen on the Klamath and Trinity
rivers, says: 'In person these people are far superior to any we had met
below; the men being larger, more muscular, and with countenances denoting
greater force and energy of character, as well as intelligence. Indeed,
they approach rather to the races of the plains, than to the wretched "diggers"
of the greater part of California.' <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. iii., p. 140. 'The
Indians in the northern portion of California and in Oregon, are vastly superior
in stature and intellect to those found in the southern part of California.'
<i>Hubbard</i>, in <i>Golden Era</i>, 1856. The Indians on the Trinity 'are of another
tribe and nature from those along the Sacramento.' <i>Kelly's Excursion</i>, vol.
ii., p. 166. Speaking of the Wallies, they, 'in many respects differ from their
brethren in the middle and lower counties of the State. They are lighter
colored and more intelligent.' <i>Johnson</i>, in <i>Overland Monthly</i>, 1869, vol. ii.,
p. 536.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_433" id="Footnote_433" href="#FNanchor_433"><span class="label">[433]</span></a> 'The males are tall, averaging in height about five feet eight inches, are
well proportioned, athletic, and possess the power of endurance to a great
degree.' <i>Hubbard</i>, in <i>Golden Era</i>, March, 1856. 'The people here (Rogue
River) were larger and stronger than those in South California, but not
handsomer.' <i>Pfeiffer's Second Journ.</i>, p. 317. Speaking of Indians on the
Klamath River, 'their stature is a trifle under the American; they have well-sized
bodies, erect and strong-knit.' <i>Powers</i>, in <i>Overland Monthly</i>, vol. viii.,
p. 328. On the upper Trinity they are 'large and powerful men, of a
swarthier complexion, fierce and intractable.' <i>Gibbs</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>,
vol. iii., p. 129. Near Mount Shasta, 'a fine-looking race, being much
better proportioned than those more to the northward, and their features
more regular.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. v., p. 254. At Klamath
Lake, 'well-grown and muscular.' <i>Lord's Nat.</i>, vol. i., p. 277. On the

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_434" id="Footnote_434" href="#FNanchor_434"><span class="label">[434]</span></a> In the vicinity of Klamath lake 'the squaws are short in comparison
with the men, and, for Indians have tolerably regular features.' <i>Lord's
Nat.</i>, vol. i., p. 277. In the Rogue River region 'some of them are quite
pretty, usually well-formed, handsomely developed, small features, and very
delicate and well-turned hands and feet.... They are graceful in their movements
and gestures, ... always timid and modest.' <i>Hubbard</i>, in <i>Golden Era</i>,
March, 1856. On the Klamath River, 'with their smooth, hazel skins, oval
faces, plump and brilliant eyes, some of the young maidens,&mdash;barring the tattooed
chins,&mdash;have a piquant and splendid beauty.' <i>Powers</i>, in <i>Overland
Monthly</i>, vol. viii., p. 329. On the Klamath and Trinity Rivers, many of the
women 'were exceedingly pretty; having large almond-shaped eyes, sometimes
of a hazel color, and with the red showing through the cheeks. Their
figures were full, their chests ample; and the younger ones had well-shaped
busts, and rounded limbs.' <i>Gibbs</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. iii., p. 140. But as
to the beauty of women tastes never agree; Mr Kelly in his <i>Excursion to Cal.</i>, vol.
ii., p. 167, speaking of a band of 'noble-looking Indians' which he met near
Trinity River, says that they were 'accompanied by a few squaws, who,
strange to say, in this latitude are ugly, ill-favoured, stunted in stature, lumpy
in figure, and awkward in gait,' and concerning the Rogue River Indians a
lady states that 'among the women ... there were some extremely clumsy
figures.' <i>Pfeiffer's Second Journ.</i>, p. 317. The Pit-River Indian girls 'have the
smallest and prettiest feet and hands I have ever seen.' <i>Miller's Life amongst

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_435" id="Footnote_435" href="#FNanchor_435"><span class="label">[435]</span></a> At Crescent City, Mr Powers saw some 'broad-faced squaws of an
almost African blackness;' the Patawats in the vicinity of Mad River and
Humboldt Bay are 'blackskinned, pudgy in stature; well cushioned with
adipose tissue;' at Redwood Creek 'like most of the coast tribes they are
very dark colored, squat in stature, rather fuller-faced than the interior Indians.'
<i>Pomo, MS.</i> At Trinidad Bay 'their persons were in general indifferently,
but stoutly made, of a lower stature than any tribe of Indians we had
before seen.' <i>Vancouver's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., p. 246. At the mouth of Eel River the
Weeyots 'are generally repulsive in countenance as well as filthy in person.... Their
heads are disproportionately large; their figures, though short,
strong and well developed.' <i>Gibbs</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. iii., p. 127. Carl
Meyer names the Indians he saw at Trinidad Bay, <i>Allequas</i>, or Wood-Indians
(Holzindianer). I do not find the name anywhere else, and judging by his
description, they appear to differ considerably from the natives seen in the
same vicinity by Vancouver or Mr Powers; he, Meyer, says; 'Sie sind von
unserm Wuchse, starke und beleibte, kräftige Gestalten. Ihre Haut ist wenig
zimmet oder lohfarbig, eher weisslich, wie die der antisischen Inkas gewesen
sein soll; bei der Jugend und besonders beim weiblichen Geschlechte schimmert
oft ein sanftes Roth auf den Wangen hervor. Ihr Kopf ist wenig
gedrückt, die Stirn hoch, der Gesichtswinkel gegen 80 Grad, die Nase römisch
gekrümmt, das Auge gross in wenig quadratisch erweiterten Augenhöhlen
und intelligent, die Lippen nicht aufgetrieben, das Kinn oval, und Hände
und Füsse klein.' <i>Nach dem Sacramento</i>, p. 215.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_436" id="Footnote_436" href="#FNanchor_436"><span class="label">[436]</span></a> At Pitt River they 'have no dress except a buckskin thrown around
them.' <i>The Shastas and their Neighbors, MS.</i> Near Mount Shasta 'they
can scarcely be said to wear any dress, except a mantle of deer or wolf
skin. A few of them had deer-skins belted around their waists, with
a highly ornamented girdle.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. v., p.
255. Near Pitt River, the Indians were nearly naked. <i>Abbott</i>, in <i>Pac. R.
R. Rept.</i>, vol. vi., p. 61. At Trinidad Bay 'their clothing was chiefly made
of the skins of land animals, with a few indifferent small skins of the
sea-otter.' <i>Vancouver's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., p. 247. 'The men, however, do not
wear any covering, except the cold is intense, when indeed they put upon
their shoulders the skins of sea-wolves, otters, deer, or other animals.'
<i>Maurelle's Jour.</i>, p. 16. 'They were clothed, for the most part, in skins.'
<i>Greenhow's Hist. Ogn.</i>, p. 118. On Smith River they were 'in a complete
state of nature, excepting only a kind of apology for an apron, worn by the
women, sometimes made of elk's skin, and sometimes of grass.' <i>Pfeiffer's
Second Journ.</i>, p. 313. Among the Weeyots at Eel River the men 'wore
a deer-skin robe over the shoulder, and the women a short petticoat of fringe.'
<i>Gibbs</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. iii., p. 127. On Klamath River their only
dress was the fringed petticoat, or at most, a deerskin robe thrown back over
the shoulders, in addition. <i>Id.</i>, p. 141. 'The primitive dress of the men is
simply a buckskin girdle about the loins; of the women, a chemise of the
same material, or of braided grass, reaching from the breast to the knees.'
<i>Powers</i>, in <i>Overland Monthly</i>, vol. viii., p. 329. 'Were quite naked excepting
the maro.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. v., p. 253. The Klamath
Lake Indians 'wear little more than the breech-cloth.' <i>Lord's Nat.</i>, vol. i., p.
277. 'They were all well dressed in blankets and buckskin.' <i>Abbott</i>, in <i>Pac.
R. R. Rept.</i>, vol. vi., p. 70. Carl Meyer, speaking of a tribe he names Allequas,
at Trinidad Bay, says: 'der Mann geht im Sommer ganz nackt, im
Winter trägt er eine selbst gegerbte Hirsch- oder Rehdecke über die Schultern.'
'Die Allequas-Weiber tragen im Sommer von Bast-Schnüren oder
von Rehfellstreifen, im Winter von Pelzwerk oder Gänseflaum verfertigte
Schürzen, die bis auf die Knie reichen.' <i>Nach dem Sacramento</i>, p. 217, 219.

one from each corner of the mouth and one in the middle, occupying
three fifths of the chin.' <i>Vancouver's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., p. 247. Maurelle says

the chin. The extent of this disfigurement indicates to a certain

lines are extended up above the corners of the mouth.' <i>Gibbs</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's

of females, and seems to be esteemed as an ornament, not apparently indicating
rank or condition.' <i>Johnston</i>, in <i>Schoolcraft's Arch.</i>, vol. iv., p. 223.
The squaws among the Cahrocs on the Klamath 'tattoo, in blue, three narrow

d'une physionomie moins repoussante.' <i>Rollin</i>, in <i>La Pérouse</i>, <i>Voy.</i>, tom. iv.,
p. 52. At San José 'the men are almost all rather above the middling stature,
and well built; very few indeed are what may be called undersized.
Their complexions are dark but not negro like ... some seemed to possess
great muscular strength; they have very coarse black hair.' Some of the
women were more than five feet six inches in height. And speaking of the
Californian Indians, in general, 'they are of a middling, or rather of a low
stature, and of a dark brown colour, approaching to black ... large projecting
lips, and broad, flat, negro-like noses; ... bear a strong resemblance to
the negroes.... None of the men we saw were above five feet high ... ill-proportioned ... we
had never seen a less pleasing specimen of the human race.'
<i>Langsdorff's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 194-5, 164, see plate. And speaking generally
of the Californian Indians: 'Die Männer sind im Allgemeinen gut gebaut
und von starker Körperbildung,' height 'zwischen fünf Fuss vier Zoll und
fünf Fuss zehn oder eilf Zoll.' Complexion 'die um ein klein wenig heller
als bei den Mulatten, also weit dunkler ist, als bei den übrigen Indianerstämmen.'

Around San Francisco Bay: 'in summer many go entirely naked. The women,
however, wear a deer-skin, or some other covering about their loins; but skin
dresses are not common.' To their ears the women 'attach long wooden
cylinders, variously carved, which serve the double purpose of ear-rings and

naked; the women take a kinde of bulrushes, and kembing it after the manner
of hemp, make themselues thereof a loose garment, which being knitte
about their middles, hanges downe about their hippes, and so affordes to them
a couering of that which nature teaches should be hidden; about their shoulders
they weare also the skin of a deere, with the haire vpon it.' The king
had upon his shoulders 'a coate of the skins of conies, reaching to his wast;
his guard also had each coats of the same shape, but of other skin.... After
these in their order, did follow the naked sort of common people, whose
haire being long, was gathered into a bunch behind, in which stucke plumes
of feathers; but in the forepart onely single feathers like hornes, every one
pleasing himselfe in his owne device.' <i>Drake's World Encomp.</i>, pp. 121, 126.
'Asi como Adamitas se presentan sin el menor rubor ni vergüenza (esto es, los

Monterey and Santa Barbara the dress 'du plus riche consiste en un
manteau da peau de loutre qui couvre ses reins et descend au dessous des

entierement nus; ceux qui ont quelques vêtements, n'ont autre
chose qu'une casaque faite de courroies de peau de lapins, de lièvres ou de
loutres tressés ensemble, et qui ont conservé le poil. Les femmes ont une espèce
de tablier de roseaux tressés qui s'attache autour de la taille par un cordon,
et pend jusqu'aux genoux; une peau de cerf mal tannée et mal préparée,
jetée sur leurs épaules en guise de manteau, compléte leur toilette.' <i>Fages</i>, in

<i>Voy.</i>, tom. ii., p. 135. Speaking generally of the Californian Indians,
'both sexes go nearly naked, excepting a sort of wrapper round the
waist, only in the coldest part of the winter they throw over their bodies a
covering of deer-skin, or the skin of the sea-otter. They also make themselves
garments of the feathers of many different kinds of water fowl, particularly
ducks and geese, bound together fast in a sort of ropes, which ropes
are then united quite close so as to make something like a feather skin.' It
is very warm. 'In the same manner they cut the sea-otter skins into small
strips, which they twist together, and then join them as they do the feathers,
so that both sides have the fur alike.' <i>Langsdorff's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 163-4.

above notes I was rather taken aback by meeting the following: 'The general
costume of nearly all the Californian Indians gives them rather an interesting
appearance; when fully dressed, their hair, which has been loose, is
tied up, either with a coronet of silver, or the thongs of skin, ornamented
with feathers of the brightest colours; bracelets made in a similar manner
are wore; breeches and leggings of doe-skin, sewed, not unfrequently with
human hair; a kind of kilt of varied coloured cloth or silk (!), fastened by
a scarf, round their waist; ... The women wear a cloth petticoat, dyed either
blue or red, doe-skin shirt, and leggings, with feathered bracelets round their
waist.' <i>Coulter's Adventures</i>, vol. i., pp. 172-3. Surely Mr Coulter should
know an Indian dress from one composed of Mexican cloth and trinkets.</p>

mica.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>, vol. v., pp. 198, 259. 'Their faces daubed

euery one had his face painted, some with white, some blacke, and some with
other colours.' <i>Drake's World Encomp.</i>, p. 126. 'Tattooing is practised in these
tribes by both sexes, both to ornament the person and to distinguish one clan
from another. It is remarkable that the women mark their chins precisely
in the same way as the Esquimaux.' <i>Beechey's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., p. 77. 'Les

<i>Voy.</i>, tom. ii., pp. 134-5. 'Tattooing is also used, but principally among
the women. Some have only a double or triple line from each corner of
the mouth down to the chin; others have besides a cross stripe extending
from one of these stripes to the other; and most have simple long and
cross stripes from the chin over the neck down to the breast and upon the
shoulders.' <i>Langsdorff's Voy.</i>, vol. ii., p. 167; see plate, p. 169. When dancing,
'ils se peignent sur le corps des lignes régulières, noires, rouges et

palatable in their natural state; Kostromitonow, however, says: 'Nachdem
die Eicheln vom Baume gepflückt sind, werden sie in der Sonne gedörrt, darauf
gereinigt und in Körben mittelst besonders dazu behauener Steine gestossen,
dann wird im Sande oder sonst wo in lockerer Erde eine Grube gegraben,

like coarse black clay, strongly resembling the soundings in Hampton roads,
and being about as savory and digestible.' <i>Revere's Tour</i>, p. 121. Never
having eaten 'coarse black clay,' I cannot say how it tastes, but according
to all other authorities, this bread, were it not for the extreme filthiness of

Lake live a tribe who are known by the name of the Monkey Indians; a
term which is not a mark of contempt, but is supposed to be a corruption of
their name.... They are reported to live in fastnesses among high mountains;
to have good clothing and houses; to manufacture blankets, shoes, and various
other articles, which they sell to the neighboring tribes. Their colour is
as light as that of the Spaniards; and the women in particular are very beautiful,
with delicate features, and long flowing hair.... Some have attempted
to connect these with an account of an ancient Welsh colony, which others
had thought they discovered among the Mandans of the Missouri; while
others were disposed to believe they might still exist in the Monkeys of the
Western Mountains. There is another account which speaks of the Monquoi
Indians, who formerly inhabited Lower California, and were partially civilized
by the Spanish missionaries, but who have left that country, and of
whom all traces have long since been lost.' <i>Wilkes' Nar.</i>, in <i>U. S. Ex. Ex.</i>,

race, of whom little is known. They are said to be fair-skinned, and are

kind of Spanish language differing from other tribes.' <i>San Francisco Evening
Bulletin</i>, <i>May 15, 1863</i>. Taylor has a note on the subject, in which he says
that these fair Indians were doubtless the Moquis of Western New Mexico.
<i>Cal. Farmer</i>, <i>June 26, 1863</i>. Although it is evident that this mysterious and
probably mythic people belong in no way to the Shoshone family, yet as
they are mentioned by several writers as dwelling in a region which is surrounded
on all sides by Shoshones, I have given this note, wherefrom the
reader can draw his own conclusions.</p>

sold for a knife or an awl, and other articles of fur in proportion. Horses
were purchased for an axe each. A ship of seventy-four guns might have

of comparatively no value, such as Indian head-dress and other curiosities,

calls the personification of the ancient gods of the Romans and Greeks, says
further that they are 'grosse, schön gewachsene Leute,' and describes their
color as 'dunkelkupferfarbig.' Of the women he adds 'Ganz im Gegensatze
zu den Männern sind die Weiber der Indianer am Colorado durchgängig
klein, untersetzt und so dick, dass ihr Aussehen mitunter an's komische
gränzt.' Comparing the Hualapais with the Mojaves he writes 'auf der einen
Seite die unbekleideten, riesenhaften und wohlgebildeten Gestalten der Mohaves ...
auf der andern Seite dagegen die im Vergleich mit erstern, zwergähnlichen,
hagern.... Figuren der Wallpays, mit ihren verwirrten, struppigen
Haaren, den kleinen, geschlitzten Augen undmden falschen, gehässigen
Ausdruck in ihren Zügen.' The Cosninos he calls 'hässlich und verkümmert.'

essa palabra, y nombre, significa, el que habla a gritos.' <i>Ribas</i>, <i>Hist. de los

chiefs and rulers of provinces and towns throughout the West Indies,
Central America, Mexico, and Peru, is originally taken from the Cuban
language. Oviedo, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. iv., p. 595, explains it as follows:
'Cacique: señor, jefe absoluto ó rey de una comarca ó Estado. En nuestros
dias suele emplearse esta voz en algunas poblaciones de la parte oriental de
Cuba, para designar al regidor decano de un ayuntamiento. Asi se dice:
Regidor cacique. Metafóricamente tiene aplicacion en nuestra península,
para designar á los que en los pueblos pequeños llevan la voz y gobiernan á
su antojo y capricho.'</p>
